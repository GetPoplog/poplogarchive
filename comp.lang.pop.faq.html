The comp.lang.pop news group has nothing to do with Post Office Protocol
or POP3.
<BR>
However, a precursor of the Pop-11 language, developed in Edinburgh
University and used for much of their research in AI in the 1970s and
after, was known as POP2. The most important core ideas of Pop-11
come from POP2. Other derivatives of POP2 were POP10, WPOP (Wonderpop),
AlphaPop (For Mac). These are all now defunct. There never was a POP3
version.

<P class="body">
The newsgroup
<A HREF="news:comp.lang.pop" class="url">comp.lang.pop</A>
was set up for discussion of the programming
language Pop-11 and other languages in the Pop family (Pop2, Pop10,
Wpop, Alphapop) and the other languages in the Poplog system, namely
Prolog, Common Lisp and ML.
</P>

<P class="body">
There is an associated email list "pop-forum", described below.
</P>

<P class="body">
One use for the news group and email list is to report bugs in Poplog
or associated libraries/packages, etc. or to request help help solving
programming problems involving one or more of the Poplog languages,
especially Pop-11, for which there is no other news group. When
reporting a bug or requesting help it may be useful to use the file:
<a href="BUGFORM.txt">
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/BUGFORM.txt</a>.
</P>
<P class="body">
 From time to time people post queries to this news group concerning
email (POP3 protocols) because they misinterpret the name of the
group. comp.lang.pop has nothing to do with email software, or the Post
office protocol.
</P>

<P class="body">
People wishing to discuss that sort of thing should post to a news
group that is more directly relevant, e.g.

<P class="body">

     <A HREF="news:comp.mail.misc" class="url">comp.mail.misc</A>
</P>

<P class="body">
or one of the other comp.mail groups. Their questions and answers
are then more likely to be read by people with relevant knowledge
and interests.

all have an open stack (like Forth),
incremental compilers (like Basic, Prolog, etc.) rich support for list
processing (like Lisp), procedures as first class objects (like Scheme),
and the compiler as a procedure which can be accessed at run time by
users.

the syntax used for function definitions and other things. E.g.
<BR>
<BR>
     Pop2 used
<PRE class="code">
            function f x y => z; ... end;
</PRE>
<BR>
         with a generally rather terse syntax
<BR>
<BR>
     Pop-11 uses
<BR>
<PRE class="code">
            define f(x,y) -> z; .... enddefine;
</PRE>
<BR>
         with a more verbose syntax (e.g. multiple closing brackets)
<BR>
<BR>
     Pop2 used this for multiple assignment, i.e. take the last three
         results produced by <CODE>foo(a, b, c)</CODE> and assign them
to <CODE>x, y, z</CODE>:
<BR>
<PRE class="code">
            foo(a, b, c) -> z -> y -> x;
</PRE>
<BR>
     Pop-11 allows both that syntax and also this:

whether there is an integrated editor (VED, the Pop-11 based

     and structures shared between C and Pop-11 (which therefore must not

<H3 class="header"><A NAME="VERSION"></A> THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
VERSION IN THE POP FAMILY <BR><A HREF="#CONTENTS" class="uri">(Back
to Contents)</A></H3>

<P class="body">
The most sophisticated version of the Pop language family is Pop-11,
developed since about 1975 at Sussex University. It was initially
implemented by Steve Hardy on a Digital Equipment PDP11/40 computer,
at first running the RSX11D operating system, which we later replaced
with Unix in 1976.
</P>

<P class="body">
 From about 1981, when it was ported to a VAX running VMS John Gibson
took over as the chief architect, though many others made important
contributions. After Chris Mellish implemented Prolog in Pop-11 (later
much improved by John Gibson with low level support in the Poplog
Virtual machine), it became known as Poplog, from about 1982. The Pop-11
language remained the core of Poplog and continued being developed until
around 1988 when commercial sales ended and Poplog became available free
of charge. It is hoped that future development will be done by a
consortium of expert users. If you are interested in joining a
developer's discussion list email A.Sloman AT cs.bham.ac.uk
</P>

<P class="body">
Pop-11 includes all the features listed above (and many more!).
There is a "primer", suitable for people with programming
experience:

<H3 class="header"><A NAME="EXTENDABILITY"></A> EXTENDABILITY USING
INCREMENTAL COMPILATION <BR><A HREF="#CONTENTS" class="uri">(Back to
Contents)</A></H3>

<P class="body">
Because Poplog incremental compiler facilities are available in a
suite of Pop-11 procedures which compile code incrementally to a
powerful general purpose virtual machine, it is not hard to develop new
languages or extensions to old ones. This is how Common Lisp, Prolog and
ML are implemented in Poplog, and many people have implemented various
extensions to Pop-11 and other languages based on Pop-11.
</P>

<P class="body">
E.g. Robin Popplestone, at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst has
implemented a version of scheme in Pop-11. It can be used in the Poplog
environment (supported by Ved) and will be automatically ported to new
hardware/software platforms whenever Poplog is ported. The scheme
package is included among those listed at

</UL>

<P class="body">
Other examples include various types of Object Oriented extensions to
Pop-11, including the Flavours package implemented in the mid 1980s, and
the Objectclass extension (similar in many ways to CLOS) added to Pop-11
in the mid 1990s.

Poprulebase, a sophisticated forward chaining rule based system for
building expert systems, cognitive models, etc. described in<BR>

Other users have at various times used Pop-11 (and other Poplog
languages) to develop various systems either for research purposes or
as products or tools used in-house. E.g. I believe the company COGSYS
sells a package based on Pop-11 for developing process control systems.
Pop-11 is also at the heart of the prize-winning Clementine data mining
system marketed world wide by ISL (Integral Solutions Ltd., address
below).

DISTRIBUTION <BR><A HREF="#CONTENTS" class="uri">(Back to

<P class="body">
Poplog was sold commercially between around 1982 and 1998. Initially
it ran on a VAX under VMS and supported only pop-11 and prolog, along
with a very simple lisp system. Common Lisp was added a few years later,
followed by Standard ML. It was later ported to many Unix platforms as
well as VMS on DEC Alpha, and linux on a PC. Until late 1998, it was
marketed commercially world wide by ISL.

<P class="body">
In 1992 ISL and Sussex University won an ICP award for achieving
five million dollars worth of sales.

by SPSS in December 1998, Poplog has been made available free of charge,
from the Birmingham Poplog directory, including sources.

All this should help revive interest especially in Pop-11, which many
users think is far better for teaching AI to novices than Java or
Prolog, and probably more approachable to many (ordinary) people than
Lisp, though lisp has many of the same benefits.

Among the free poplogs is a version which runs under windows95/98/NT,
though without the X-based graphical facilities. That has never been
sold separately by ISL though they use it for Clementine on PCs under
NT.

<P class="body">
Perhaps with the sources available someone will port Poplog's graphical
tools to the Windows environment. (ISL use a commercial package which
emulates X on a PC, but that is out of the question for most users
because of costs.)

<H3 class="header"><A NAME="HISTORY"></A> SOME HISTORY <BR><A
HREF="#CONTENTS" class="uri">(Back to Contents)</A></H3>

<P class="body">
The first of the Pop family of languages was originally developed in the
late 1960s by Robin Popplestone. After some evolution (and re-naming) it
was used for research in Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University
throughout most of the 1970s and beyond, though other languages (e.g.
Prolog, Common Lisp, ML) were favoured by some of the AI research
groups.
</P>

<P class="body">
I learnt Pop2 there running on an Elliot 4130 computer in 1972-3. Most
of the multi-user operating system was implemented in pop2. (There was a
single heap shared by all users!) A Pop2 manual ("the silver book") was
published by Edinburgh University Press sin 1972 or 1973, but has long
been out of print.
</P>

<P class="body">
The other Pop languages grew out of pop2, with the usual divergence as
languages evolve, but the only version that has survived as far as I
know is Pop-11 in the Poplog environment.

Alphapop was a Mac based version of a subset of pop-11 (e.g. not
including lexically scoped variables), developed and sold by Cognitive
Applications in the late 1980s, but has not been updated for the latest

If they put the sources in the public domain perhaps someone will bring

(NOTE: it was designed for use with an 8-bit graphic display. If used on
a machine with 16 or 24 bit "Truecolour" you will need to start X up in
8 bit mode to use the display facilities in popvision. It is hoped that
the relevant procedures will be generalised later.)

<H3 class="header"><A NAME="LOOK"></A> WHAT DOES POP-11 LOOK LIKE?
<BR><A HREF="#CONTENTS" class="uri">(Back to Contents)</A></H3>

<P class="body">
Pop-11 is an incrementally compiled language with power comparable
to Common Lisp but with a syntax closer to more conventional
languages.  E.g. here is a typical procedure definition in Pop-11,
for testing whether an item is in a list (equivalent to the built in
pop-11 procedure member):
</P>

<PRE class="code">

    define is_in(item, list) -> result;
         ;;; Return true if item is in the list, otherwise false

         lvars thing;
         for thing in list do
             if thing = item then
                 true -> result; return();
             endif
         endfor;

         ;;; not found, so
         false -> result;
     enddefine;

     ;;; Test it: the result is left on the stack. Stack contents are
     ;;; printed out using the "=>" operator:
     is_in(3, [2 3 5 8])=>
     ** &lt;true&gt;

     ;;; More tests showing the generality of a type-free definition
     is_in("three", [one two three]) =>
     ** &lt;true&gt;

     is_in("three", [one 1 two 2 three 3]) =>
     ** &lt;true&gt;

     is_in(3, [one two three]) =>
     ** &lt;false&gt;</PRE>

<P class="body">
The same thing can be defined recursively, in a more familiar functional
style as often used in Lisp or Scheme, and without using an output
variable in the header (unused results are left on the "user stack" in
any case).
</P>

<PRE class="code">

    define is_in(item, list);
         if null(list) then false
         elseif item = hd(list) then true
         else is_in(item, tl(list))
         endif
     enddefine;

     ;;; Test it:
     is_in("cat", [bat cat dog elephant])=>
     ** &lt;true&gt;

     is_in(3, [one two three])=>
     ** &lt;false&gt;</PRE>

<P class="body">
Compare a Lisp (or Scheme?) equivalent:
</P>

<PRE class="code">

    (defun is_in(item list)
         (cond
             ((null list) nil)
             ((equal item (car list)) t)
             (t (is_in item (cdr list)))))

     ; Test it
     (is_in `cat `(bat cat dog elephant))
     T
</PRE>

<P class="body">
[NOTE: in Pop-11, the infix operator "=" corresponds to "EQUAL"
in Lisp, whereas "==" corresponds to "EQ".]
</P>

<P class="body">
Pop-11 also has pattern matching built in, support for developing new
incrementally compiled languages, an object oriented subsystem similar
to CLOS, an interface to the X window system, and many other features.
</P>

<P class="body">
This is how the pattern matcher could be used to define is_in:
</P>

<PRE class="code">    define is_in(item, list) -> result;
         list matches [== ^item == ] -> result;
     enddefine;
</PRE>

<P class="body">
Where "==" matches arbitrary segments of a list. The use of a pattern
matcher makes it much easier to develop knowledge-based systems.
</P>

<P class="body">
Lots more examples of Pop-11 code can be found in the Primer and online
teach files, described above, and in source code libraries in the Poplog
directory:

<H3 class="header"><A NAME="POPLOG"></A> THE POPLOG VIRTUAL MACHINE
AND TWO LEVEL COMPILER <BR><A HREF="#CONTENTS" class="uri">(Back to
Contents)</A></H3>

<P class="body">
Poplog is a multi-language Artificial Intelligence development
environment, in which Pop-11 is the core language and Prolog, Common
Lisp, and Standard ML are also supported in any combination.
</P>

<P class="body">
The implementation of Pop-11 and all the other language is based on
pop-11 tools for developing incremental compilers that can also be used
to implement other languages which will then run wherever Poplog does.
</P>

<P class="body">
Poplog provides a high level language-independent and machine-
independent virtual machine (the Poplog Virtual Machine) which is rich
enough to support a wide range of languages. There are Pop-11 procedures
for planting instructions for this virtual machine. When the
instructions reach the end of a procedure definition, the high level PVM
instructions are compiled in a machine independent fashion to a low
level Poplog Implementation Machine. The instructions at that level are
then compiled incrementally (a procedure at a time) using a machine
dependent "back end" compiler to instructions for the current machine.
This two level incremental compiler is used by all the Poplog languages.
</P>

<P class="body">
Poplog compiled procedures are data-structures in the heap and can be
garbage collected, unlike compiled procedures in some other AI
languages.
</P>

<P class="body">
During system development and porting to a new machine a different back
end is used which produces files of assembler for the target machine
(and other information required during the linking phase).
</P>

<P class="body">
Because of all this most of the core of the Poplog system is implemented
in Pop-11 (in a special dialect with some C-like extensions to provide
more efficient low level mechanism.) Building a new version therefore
always requires access to a running Poplog. The advantage of using
Pop-11 as the main implementation language rather than C or C++ is that
Pop-11 (like Lisp) is a higher level language making system development
much easier and more reliable. Also new features can be developed as
Pop-11 code in libraries available to users, and then after thorough
testing can later be incorporated into the system.
