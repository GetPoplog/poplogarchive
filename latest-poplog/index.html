<p>
<b>What is Poplog?</b>
<br>
Poplog is a multi-language software development environment that has proved
itself useful for teaching absolute beginners programming and AI, and supporting
major commercial software projects, including Clementine a leading
user-extendable data-mining toolkit in the 1990s, later incorporated into IBM's
business development software. "Poplog" was a trade-mark of the University of
Sussex from about 1983 to 2015.
<p>
The core language of Poplog is Pop-11, derived from the Edinburgh University
POP-2 Programming language developed for AI research in the 1970s.
<p>
The other languages are all implemented in Pop-11.
<p>
<b>Some online information about the Pop-11 language:</b>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/primer">The Pop-11 Primer</a>
<br>
Pop-11 uses a virtual machine with compiler tools available at run time, that
can support a variety of very different incrementally compiled programming
languages.
<p>
Poplog is supplied with implementations of three additional well known
languages, Prolog, Common Lisp, and Standard ML, but particular applications can
include application-specific languages implemented in Pop-11. An example is the
Poprulebase language used in the SimAgent toolkit:

<b>Information about ISL (Integral Solutions Limited)</b>
<br>
Poplog was initially developed by AI staff and students at the University of
Sussex, to support teaching and research in AI and cognitive science. A few
years later, commercial distribution and support were taken over by a UK
company, Systems Designers. Later ISL, a much smaller company, was spun off from
Systems Designers, and focused on marketing and supporting Poplog, in
collaboration with Sussex University, and developing products based on it. ISL
made significant contributions to its contents. Some of the history can be found
here:

<b>Copyright</b>
<br>
Around 1998, after ISL was taken over by SPSS (which was later taken over by
IBM), Sussex University, who owned the copyright agreed to make Poplog freely

<H2><b>
INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING PRE-LINKED 32-BIT LINUX POPLOG V15.65
</b></H2>
<b>NEW (14 Oct 2015)</b>
<br>
The packaging and installation of linux poplog has been considerably simplified
by removing options that would probably have been confusing and unnecessary for
new users. The new scripts to download and install Poplog require poplog to be
configured for use with the X11 (X-Window) graphical tools, including the
(Open)Motif or Lesstif package, and by default install poplog in
/usr/local/poplog, though expert users can edit the scripts to use a different
location.
<p>
Download and install scripts are provided both for <b>Fedora</b> (which should
also work for other RedHat-based versions of linux) and for <b>Ubuntu</b> (which
may work for other Debian-based versions of linux). The scripts should enable
32-bit Poplog to work on 64-bit or 32-bit Linux systems. (64-bit Poplog details
are at the top of this page.)

<p>
Because these scripts also install linux system packages, they need to be run
as root (superuser) or using the 'sudo' command. So, after fetching the script,
make it executable using 'chmod', e.g.
<pre>
    sudo chmod 755 script-name
</pre>
Then run the script, e.g. using the instruction format:
<pre>
    sudo ./script-name
</pre>
Fetch the appropriate script, using your browser's 'save as' option, or using
the 'wget' command with the URL.
<div style="margin-left:-20px; margin-top:0px;">
<ul>
<li>
Get and install 32-bit Poplog on 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu (or similar Debian
based system):
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-prelinked-ubuntu-poplog">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-prelinked-ubuntu-poplog</a>
<p>
<li>
Get and install 32-bit poplog on 32-bit or 64-bit Fedora (or similar RedHat
based system):
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-prelinked-fedora-poplog">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/get-prelinked-fedora-poplog</a>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
Each script first installs a collection of linux library packages required for
poplog to run, then fetches a new (fetch-and-install) script from here, which
can then be run to download and install poplog.
That fetch-and-install script available <a href="#main-script">below</a> can
be used with any version of linux on which the required packages (listed
below for <a
href="#fedora-required">Fedora</a> and <a href="#ubuntu-required">Ubuntu</a>)
have already been installed.
<a name="main-script"></a>
<h3><b>
The main fetch and install script
</b></h3>
This is downloaded and run by the previous two scripts, to finish off the
installation after required linux packages have been installed.
<br/>

</small>
<p>
This can be downloaded by hand, made executable, and run, if you have already
installed the required linux packages. It fetches a tar file (size about 17MB)
and unpacks it into a directory (/usr/local/poplog, which it creates if
necessary), then adds some links in that directory to the newly installed files,
and finally runs an installation script that builds 'saved images' to go into
the 'popsavelib' directory, to make available usable versions of Pop11, Prolog,
Common Lisp and Standard ML, and multi window version XVed of the poplog editor
Ved. By default it installs saved images for two demonstration programs (a
chatbot, eliza, and a mini blocks world demo, partly inspired by Terry
Winograd's SHRDLU program (around 1971).

If you need poplog for another version of linux you can use the main fetch and
install script after you have installed the appropriate packages. To help you
work out what you will need, here are the pre-requisite packages fetched for
Fedora and other redhat-related linus, and the pre-requisites for Ubuntu.

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
I am not an Arch user, so I am grateful to <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/about/people/showperson.php?person_id=5264">Peter Lewis</a> for advice and suggestions.
I welcome criticisms and further suggestions from Arch users who try this system.
<p>
Peter has produced this script, which may suffice for knowledgeable Arch users:

<p>
Arch users wishing to get the latest poplog directly from here should be able to install
it provided that
<br>
(a) if 64-bit arch is in use then the Multilib facilities will have to be enabled
as described in
    <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/news/true-multilib-for-arch-linux-x86_64/">http://www.archlinux.org/news/true-multilib-for-arch-linux-x86_64/</a>
<p>
(b) a collection of libraries has been installed, especially xterm, and
    'lib32-libxext' 'lib32-libxt' 'lib32-openmotif' 'lib32-libxp' 'tcsh'
<br>
and optionally 'espeak' (useful for some of the demos).
<p>
Try downloading and running this script, which will attempt to install
the above packages, then give you the option to abort or continue, then
install poplog in /usr/local/poplog (plus a few symbolic links):

<hr/>
<p>
<b>NOTE: Other versions of linux</b>

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; ">
People using other versions of linux should check that they have
the gcc libraries, csh/tcsh and "development" versions of
<pre>
    either
        motif

    or
        lesstif
</pre>
E.g. you should be able to install one of those using 'yum install'
in RedHat/Fedora systems and similar systems, e.g. CentOS, Scientific Linux:

<pre>
    yum install lesstif-devel.i686
</pre>

Make sure that you have the 'devel' packages for the X11 libraries
installed. Otherwise the link commands in the poplog installation
scripts will fail. E.g. you could use the following, in addition
to the commands for installing motif (or lesstif):

<pre>
    yum install libX11-devel.i686 libXt-devel.i686 libXext-devel.i686
</pre>

If you would like to try the linear algebra package included in the popvision
library <a href="#optional">mentioned above</a> ($usepop/pop/packages/popvision)
then, if you are a Fedora user, add this command to install the BLAS and LAPACK
linear algebra libraries:

<pre>
    yum install blas-devel.i686 lapack-devel.i686
</pre>

For Ubuntu that would be
<pre>
    apt-get install libblas-dev:i386 liblapack-dev:i386
</pre>

That can be done after installing Poplog. Users of other versions of linux will
have to investigate what commands are required.

<hr>
<p>
<b>NOTE: use of motif/lesstif</b>
<blockquote>
The graphical facilities in Poplog are all  based on the X window
system (sometimes also called X11), described here
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System</a>
<p>
This has the great advantage of supporting remote use of graphical
tools: the tools can run on a machine in one location while users
are using a machine connected to it by a network. This is now
commonplace using web browsers, but the X window system, based on
Unix, had the idea long before there were web browsers. Poplog
provides a wide range of 2-D graphical facilities based on X. There
are some library packages that extend the X facilities and one of
those is the 'motif' widget toolkit, which is used by many tools
that run on linux and unix. It is described
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(widget_toolkit)">here</a>.
<br/>
A royalty free version is OpenMotif described
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Motif">here</a>. Some
unix distributors object to licence conditions of both Motif and
OpenMotif and have switched to using an open source
non-proprietary replacement called Lesstif, described
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessTif">here.</a> Lesstif is
almost fully compatible with Motif, but not quite, and this has
caused minor problems for poplog,

However, most 64-bit linux AMD64 systems or equivalent (e.g. x86_64) should
support 32 bit applications, provided that you install the required 32 bit
libraries before installing poplog. So the installation procedures for Fedora
and Ubuntu introduced above, should install 32-bit poplog on 32-bit or 64-bit
versions of Linux, which may be the simplest option.
<p>
The RCLIB graphical extension to Poplog, described
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/rclib">here</a>,
was designed to work without Motif.
<p>
However there are some advantages in the use of Poplog with
motif, insofar as the graphical version of the editor, XVed, then has
menu buttons and a scrollbar if Motif or Lesstif is available.
