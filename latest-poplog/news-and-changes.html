19 Feb 2012: Slight change to version 15.65. pop_internal_version 156500
<br/>
Default commands would not link motif on new version of Ubuntu. This
turned out to be due to new linker default on Ubuntu but not included in Fedora.
<br/>
A fix was added to $usepop/pop/src/syscomp/asmout.p to produce a
slightly different shell script to link a new poplog.

27 Dec 2011: Version 15.65 now available. pop_internal_version 156500
<br/>
<small>
Reverted to old decimal format (v15.65, not v15.6.5, to avoid internal
complications).
</small>
<br/>
A major change to Ved: the code for optimising screen refreshing during
scrolling part of the screen has been disabled.
<br/>
It worked properly only in xterm windows. Various other console windows did not
support the optimisation properly,
<br/>
e.g. urxvt (and its variants), and this caused
corruption of the editor window.
<br/>
(Thanks to Will Price for pointing out the urgent need, and for help
testing the changes.)
<br/>
Installation procedure unchanged.

NEWS 5 Aug 2009: Version 15.6301 (pop_internal_version 156301)
</b></h4>
<pre>
    Installation scripts simplified ('bham' parameter no longer needed)
    Error handling in Ved improved (thanks to help from Steve Isard)

NEWS 29 Jun 2009: Version 15.63 (pop_internal_version 156300)
<pre>
    Removed special Ved characters from all the documentation files to make
    things easy for people who don't wish to learn to use Ved or XVed.
</pre>
</b></h4>
The main difference between this version (v15.63) and the previous
version
<a href="../v15.62">v15.62</a> is that in V15.63 version all the
Poplog documentation files were converted so that they can now be
read in any text editor or web browser. Previously the files
included special graphical characters for use with the Poplog editor
Ved/XVed. This was a disadvantage for users who did not wish to
switch to a new editor, even though the poplog editor has many
convenient built in links with the rest of poplog, including the
compilers, the documentation directories and the library
directories.

Changes to Popvision
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/popvision/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/popvision/</a>
</b></h4>
<pre>
    Two changes to the Sussex popvision library, described in
        $usepop/pop/packages/popvision/README.bham

        1. popvision/lib/Xcolour_to_rgb.p
            added directory '/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt'
            to  Xcolour_to_rgb_filelist

        2. popvision/lib/sunrasterfile.p
            Installed fix by Jack Hollingworth (Reading University) for
            updater of sunrasterfile for use on little-endian machines.

<b>NEWS 4 Dec 2008: Version 15.62</b>
</h4>
<pre>
    This version makes it unnecessary to use 'setarch', thanks to
    code supported by Waldek Hebisch
    For more detailed changes see

<h4><b>
NEWS: 31st March 2008
</b></h4>
<pre>
    A problem in the editor that made it produce multiple copies of
    the same file (especially output.p) has been identified and removed.

<li>
<h4><b>
NEWS 25 Dec 2007
</b></h4>
<pre>
    Expanded the <a href="index.html#ubuntu">instructions for Ubuntu users,</a> which turned out to
    be incomplete.

    Also modified several of the Poplog scripts to invoke 'bash' instead of 'sh',
    as it turns out that these two are not equivalent on all systems.
    (Ubuntu Gutsy links 'sh' to 'dash', not 'bash')

<h4><b>
NEWS 23 Nov 2007: New highlighting command for editor
</b></h4>
<pre>
    Added simple pop-11 syntax highlighting command for VED, in
        $usepop/pop/lib/ved/ved_highlight.p

    The command
        ENTER highlight
    will underline all syntax words, apart from those included in
    the list assigned to global variable
        highlight_exceptions

    To see what the exceptions are do
        ENTER showlib highlight_exceptions

    If you don't want to fetch a complete poplog system, the file
    can be downloaded on its own from
        <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.62/v15.62/pop/lib/ved/ved_highlight.p">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.62/v15.62/pop/lib/ved/ved_highlight.p</a>
    Simply install it in the directory $usepop/pop/lib/ved/ in your
    current poplog system. It will then be autoloadable.
    Undo highlighting with ENTER strip

NEWS 5 Oct 2007:
    New version of Poplog v15.61: pop_internal_version 156101
</b></h4>
<pre>
    The most important change is that the problem described in Bug 32
    in here (originally reported by Steve Leach):

    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/bugfixes/BUGREPORTS">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/bugfixes/BUGREPORTS</a>

     -- 32. (18 Feb 2004) Bug in current_directory under Linux (and Unix?)

    has started causing serious problems with new releases of Linux
    installed with enhanced security settings. This was reported
    recently to the poplog-dev list by Stephen Isard.

    The problem was fixed by changing the pop-11 mechanism for
    getting at the current directory, provided by Waldek Hebisch
    and described in the BUGREPORTS file as item 66:

     -- 66. 29 Sep 2007 New version of unix_dir.p

    There are a few other minor improvements to the installation
    process. The easiest way to fetch and install 32 bit Linux
    Poplog remains the use of one of
    <a href="index.html#get-install">the get-and-install scripts</a> described below.

<h4><b>
NEWS 11 Sep 2007: Poplog version 15.61
</b></h4>
<pre>
    New version of Poplog v15.61 available, with minor fixes and
    revamped scripts to overcome the problems caused by Linux
    security settings. Most easily installed by running one of
    <a href="#get-install">the get-and-install scripts</a> described below.

    There is a new file that gives an overview of what happens when
    the poplog installation script is run. It is available as
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/INSTALLATION-OVERVIEW.txt">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog/INSTALLATION-OVERVIEW.txt</a>
