BUG REPORTS

This file is accessible as

or
    ftp://ftp.cs.bham.ac.uk/pub/dist/poplog/BUGFORM.txt

It is based on the Bug Report form which used to be distributed with
Poplog.

Since Poplog is no longer sold as a commercial product there is no
longer an "official" form for reporting bugs or for making enhancement
requests.

However, it is possible to ask the user community for help by posting a
request to the comp.lang.pop news group.

There may be additional mechanisms for finding help available through
the Poplog WEB site:

    http://www.poplog.org

If you do wish to post a request for help, you can make the task of
helpers as easy as possible by using the rest of this file as a
framework for your request.

Please edit the file as appropriate, then post it WITHOUT this
explanatory header.

Note: If you have recently acquired a new version of the operating
system, and the bug manifests itself ONLY on the new version, then it
MAY be the case that some of the libraries have changed and your problem
will go away if you re-link Poplog, as described in HELP NEWPOP.

You can expect more helpful replies from other users if you follow these
guidelines:

1. In the case of bugs, please keep original code/saved images, etc.,
   manifesting the bug available in case required for testing.

2. Please always mention which make and model of computer you are using,
   which operating system and version it is running and the version of
   Poplog you are using.

3. Please give a precise description, including sufficient code to
   reproduce undesired behaviour.

4. Include a record of interaction if possible.

5. Please do not use vague statements such as:
    "There's something wrong with procedure FOO"
    "If I do X the results are bizarre"
    "I can't get X to work"
    "X doesn't seem able to handle big lists"
    "X doesn't work inside the editor..."

6. If the problem is a discrepancy between documentation and observed
   behaviour please specify which documentation file or manual.
