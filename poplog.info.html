<h2><b>What is POPLOG?</b></h2>
POPLOG is a free, open source, multi-language software development
environment providing incremental compilers for a number of interactive
programming languages, notably:
<blockquote>
    <UL>
    <LI><a href="primer/index.html">Pop-11</a>
        <BR>
            (the core language of Poplog, derived from

            Edinburgh AI language developed in the 60s and 70s
            and extended at Sussex University in the 80s and 90s,
            including a rich interface to the X window system and
            a powerful Object Oriented programming extension,
            Objectclass, developed by Steve Leach now a standard part of
            the language (comparable to CLOS as an extension of LISP).)

<P>
Poplog provides support for multi-paradigm software development in a
rapid prototyping environment, because of the use of (fast) incremental
compilers for all the languages.
<p>
In Poplog, all the above languages compile to a common virtual machine,
which is then compiled (incrementally) to the current host machine
language. Users can add new languages or extend the existing languages
because the compiler development tools are made available (in the form
of Pop-11 procedures, as explained in the Primer
<a href="cas-ai/pop11-primer.html">HTML</a> or <a href="cas-ai/pop11-primer.pdf">PDF</a> version).
<p>
Poplog also includes a lot of X related facilities, an integrated
multi-window programmable text editor (VED), and a host of teaching
material and libraries provided in source. The system was developed
mainly at Sussex University, but also at
Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL) between 1988 and 1998. ISL was bought by
<a href="http://www.spss.com">SPSS</a>
(who sell the
<a href="http://www.spss.com/clementine/">Clementine data-mining system</a>
originally developed in Poplog by ISL).

Some Poplog/Pop-11 History
</B></H2>
<p>
Poplog grew out of the Pop-11 language produced at Sussex University
building on the many excellent ideas in the Pop2 language, originally
developed by Robin Popplestone (see below) and others at Edinburgh
University in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
<p>
At Sussex Pop-11 was implemented (mainly by Steve Hardy) to run on a
PDP11/40 computer running Unix, round about 1976. It was later ported to
a VAX running VMS, and John Gibson was the main architect thereafter.
Around 1981-2 Chris Mellish implemented a version of Prolog in Pop-11,
and the combined system was then called Poplog. A few years later a
"toy" Lisp system was added by Jonathan Cunningham, and after that a
full Common Lisp was implemented by John Williams, with supporting
changes to the Poplog virtual machine produced by John Gibson. Later
Robert Duncan and Simon Nichols added an implementation of Standard ML.
<p>
One of the key features originally in Pop-11 and later in Poplog was
support for e-learning. An overview of the philosophy and history of
some of the features developed from 1976 at Sussex University can be
found
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/poplog-learning-environment.html">
here.</a> A central theme in all the computer-based learning techniques
developed in Pop-11 and Poplog was always leaving the learner in total
control.
<p>
Poplog was originally sold to commercial and academic users (at very
different prices!) by Sussex University (starting around 1982), when it
contained only Pop-11 and Prolog (hence the name.)
<p>
SDL (Systems Designers Ltd) took over marketing in 1983 (and had
a Poplog stand at IJCAI83 in Karlsruhe). Later, following a merger, SDL
grew into SD-Scicon, one of the largest software companies in the UK,
which later changed its name to SD, and then became
<a href="http://www.eds.co.uk">EDS</a>
<p>
In 1989 SD decided to pull out of the AI tools market and a small group
of people in the company (about 6) who had been associated with Poplog
bought out the Poplog business (and also the SD-prolog business) and
started ISL. At first their business was mainly selling and supporting
Poplog (while Sussex University remained closely involved in
development). They also provided AI services, developed various kinds of
AI software.
<p>
During the 1990s ISL developed and diversified, including producing the
prize winning <a href="http://www.spss.com/clementine/">
Clementine Data Mining System,</a> which was originally implemented
mainly in Pop-11, making considerable use of Pop-11 (as did
other systems produced by clients of ISL, e.g.
<a href="http://www.cogsys.co.uk"> COGSYS</a>), and some products of
<a href="http://www.praxis-cs.co.uk">Praxis</a>.
<p>
In December 1998
<a href="http://www.spss.com">SPSS</a> bought ISL (a friendly takeover)
and following that, discussions began with Sussex regarding the future
of Poplog. This eventually led to the Free Poplog site.
<p>
<H2><B>FREE POPLOG ONLINE</B></H2>
In July 1999 it was decided that the latest version of Poplog (V15.53)
including sources for all supported hardware/operating system
combinations, should be made available free of charge. For information
about this see
<a href="freepoplog.html">
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html</a>
<p>
There is a smaller out of date free version of Poplog (Version 15.01),
which apparently still works on SUSE Linux, though not on other recent
versions of Linux. It is available by ftp from Sussex University in the
Sussex Linux Poplog distribution directory: <a
href="ftp://ftp.cogs.susx.ac.uk/pub/poplog/poplog15.0">
ftp://ftp.cogs.susx.ac.uk/pub/poplog/poplog15.0 </a>
<br>
This old version has some restrictions: it is memory-limited and you
cannot create saved images. But most of the teaching material in
older books on pop-11 can be used on it, though not the newer facilities
at the Birmingham Poplog ftp site.
<p>
<h2><B>Platforms</B></h2>
Poplog has, at various times, run on a variety of Unix and VMS machines,
including Sun, HP, SGI, DEC Alpha, DEC Vax, Sequent Symmetry, Apollo Unix, and
PC running Redhat Linux v5.2 (and maybe other versions of Linux). There was also
a Windows NT version of Poplog produced by ISL (e.g. used in Clementine on PCs)
but without graphics, unless you purchase an X window system emulator for NT.
As far as I know that system has not been available since SPSS were purchased
ISL.

a Poplog information site, which included poplog-related and

libraries. Most of the material has been transferred to and absorbed into

<p>
Steve Leach <sfkleach@gmail.com> while working at HP research laps
