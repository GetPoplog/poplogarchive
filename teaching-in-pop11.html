Teaching materials for Poplog/Pop-11/AI/General programming
</b></h3>
The Pop-11 teaching materials provided in Poplog allow students at
all levels to learn about many aspects of both general programming
and Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, by designing,
implementing, testing, documenting their own programs and using,
testing, extending, and analysing working programs provided.
<p>
The core language, Pop-11, in some ways like Python, in other ways
like Lisp, can also be used to introduce a variety of common
programming paradigms, including use of loops, recursion,
co-routines, rule-based programming, event-driven programming, list
processing, pattern matching for structure manipulation, numerical
programming, array programming, use of object oriented programming
with multiple inheritance, and uses of higher order functions and
closures (as in Scheme). A linear algebra package based on
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">Lapack</a>
and
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> is described
<a href="doc/popvision/help/popmatlab">here,</a>
<a href="doc/popvision/help/lapop">here,</a> and
<a href="doc/popvision/help/lapack">here.</a>
<p>
A subset of Pop-11 with graphical facilities provides the
functionality of the LOGO Turtle, but with many additional features
available, illustrated
<a href="figs/rclib/">here</a> and in this tutorial introduction
to making
<a href="teach/faces">pictures of faces</a>, and combining
graphical commands with loops, and list processing.
<p>
There are many 'teach' files developed at Sussex University,
Birmingham University and elsewhere,
introducing concepts and techniques, with exercises ranging from
simple program completion to development of whole systems, some of
them making use of packages provided by tutors to hide details for
beginners:
e.g.
some basic programming and AI teach files
<a href="doc/popteach">here</a> and
<a href="doc/bhamteach">here</a>, including a tutorial on building
a simple
<a href="doc/bhamteach/respond">chatbot based on pattern matching</a>
an
introduction to
<a href="doc/bhamteach/grammar.txt">grammars, parsing. sentence
generation</a>,
<a href="doc/bhamteach/storygrammar">generation of stories and
haikus
<a/>;
some general programming including recursion and list-processing
<a href="doc/popteach/sets">here</a> and
<a href="doc/popteach/sets2">here</a> (with answers available);
some rule-based programming
examples
<a href="newkit/prb/teach">here</a>,
the use of the
<a href="packages/simagent.html">SimAgent</a> Toolkit
<a href="newkit/sim/teach">here</a> and The Sussex
University Popvision tutorials
<a href="doc/popvision/teach">here</a>, and a book, originally
published by MIT Press, though now out of print, providing an
introduction to Cognitive Science/AI using Pop-11 is
<a href="computers-and-thought">here</a>. It uses an older
version of the Pop-11 syntax, which is still supported in Poplog.
A Pop-11 programming primer for people with previous programming
experience, using the current syntax is
<a href="primer">here.</a>

<p>
<b>Editor, documentation and libraries</b>
<br/>
The environment has many of the interactive features of interpreted
languages, though the Poplog languages are all incrementally
compiled to machine code for efficiency. The 'TEACH' files, and
other documentation files, are accessible through an integrated
visual editor (Ved, also usable as
<a href="figs/rclib/index.html#xved">XVed, in multi-window mode</a>),
which 'knows about' the compilers, the program libraries and the
documentation libraries, and is extendable since it is implemented
in Pop-11. E.g. a tutorial file can have a hypertext link to other
documentation or to program libraries. Programming examples can be
run from inside the editor, then modified and run again, without
restarting the editor or Poplog.
<blockquote>
<small>
For Emacs users there is <a href="#emacsstuff">a conversion
package</a> that extends Emacs to support integration with the
Pop-11 compiler. Another option, for people who do not wish to use a
new editor is to type commands into the Pop-11 (or Prolog, or Lisp,
or ML) prompt in a shell command line, while editing and reading
documentation quite separate editor. This will add some
inconvenience and slow down development a little. (To a 'normal'
edit/compile/test loop.)
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are many libraries extending the core system to support various
kinds of programming tasks. For example
<a href="packages/simagent.html">the SimAgent toolkit</a>
supports exploration of architectures for more or
less intelligent agents. The library and documentation system make
use of search lists, allowing packages and teaching materials
developed by different teachers, students and researchers to be
combined flexibly, strongly encouraging team teaching.
(Used for many years at Sussex University.)
<p>
There is also a collection of libraries and tutorials related to
computer vision, i.e. image analysis and interpretation, in
<a href="#popvision">David Young's "Popvision" Library</a>
including
neural net, array manipulation, and linear algebra utilities.
<p>
Some of the Poplog/Pop11 graphical facilities are illustrated
<a href="figs/rclib">here</a>, and there are
<a href="figs/simagent">movies</a> showing some student AI projects,
based on the the SimAgent toolkit.

A history of developments in e-learning using Pop-11 and Poplog,
starting at Sussex University in 1976 can be found
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/poplog-learning-environment.html">here</a>.
<p>
For many years Poplog was an expensive commercial product, first
sold commercially by Sussex University for use on VAX+VMS (for
UK&pound;3,000, and much less for academics)
in 1982, and then continually developed, ported to other platforms, and
commercially supported up to 1998, first by Systems Designers (from
1983) and later by a spin-off, Integral Solutions Ltd (founded in 1989).
<p>
At one stage the commercial price was UK&pound;7,500 (+VAT) for
workstations, though the educational price was always much lower.
Poplog was a solid, reliable, commercial product, used mainly,
though not entirely, for AI and Software Engineering research,
development and teaching. By about 1992 sales had exceeded
$5,000,000.
<p>
The most famous product implemented in Poplog (mainly Pop-11) was
the
<a href="http://www.spss.com/software/modeling/modeler/">Clementine Data Mining system,</a>
developed by ISL, as a result of which they were bought by SPSS, so
that Clementine (now called "PASW modeller"), could be integrated
with their other data-mining tools (after re-writing in Java and
C++, with some loss of functionality). Another product based on
Poplog was a software validation toolkit produced by Praxis.
