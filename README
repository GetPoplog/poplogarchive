FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE POPLOG DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY AND POPLOG
This directory is accessible as either
    ftp://ftp.cs.bham.ac.uk/pub/dist/poplog/
or
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/

It contains several sub-directories which provide local extensions to
Poplog files which may be copied and used elsewhere. It also contains
Poplog distrbution directories, as described in the freepoplog.html
file.

Also included here is teaching material used in introductory AI courses
at the University of Birmingham (including some revised versions
of online teaching material distributed with Poplog, originally
produced at the University of Sussex.)

There are also extensions to Pop-11 used for research purposes at
Birmingham and elsewhere, e.g. the poprulebase (prb) and sim_agent (sim)
and relative coordinate graphics (rclib) libraries. The popvision
library produced by David Young at Sussex University the version of
Scheme in Pop-11 implemented by Robin Popplestone at the University of
Massachussetts at Amherst are also included. Expect new additions, from
time to time, which will be included in the freepoplog.html file.

Steve Leach (steve@watchfield.com) has set up a Poplog information
site, which includes a remotely accessible Pop-11 system, so that you
can try out pop-11 at a distance. See:

=======================================================================
FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
    (Description probably out of date and incomplete now.)

The teaching material includes "teach" files and "help" files in the
teach/ and help/ sub-directories, and also Pop-11 program libraires in
the the auto/ and lib/ sub-directories. There are several other
directories containing "packages" implemented in Pop-11. For some
of these, compressed tar files are provided with file names of the
form *.tar.gz

Extension to the pop-11 pattern matcher:
    Some people have rightly objected that the pattern matcher
    available in Pop-11 is not safe to use because the variables in it
    have to be dynamically scoped. At Birmingham we have overcome this
    by introducing a pattern prefix "!" defined as an autoloadable
    syntax word in
        auto/!.p

    which compiles
        lib/readpattern.p

    This converts all pattern variables to identifiers which are by
    default lexically scoped in the current procedure.

    A large amount of teaching material in the
        teach/
    subdirectory, and associated code in the auto/ and lib/ directories
    have been convered to use this syntax. The main items are also in
    the compressed tar file

        bhamteachtar.gz


Please note that there is no guarantee that anything is bug-free.
Everything may be freely copied and used, so long as copyright notices
are retained.

CONTENTS OF THE DIRECTORY

    poplog.info.html
        Pointers to more information about Poplog

The Pop-11 primer (several versions):

    primer.gz
        This is a compressed version of
            teach/primer
        a plain text version of the Pop-11 primer, for online browsing
        (17997 lines long):

        This is an introduction to Pop-11 which is suitable for people
        who already know some programming. It also gives a lot of
        information about poplog.

    primer.tex.gz
        Compressed version of latex file semi-automatically generated
        from the plain text version of the Pop-11 primer. This can be
        used to generate html if you have the latex2html program, or
        to regenerate the postscript versions. It requires the file
    popmodel.eps
        to create a diagram of a simplified model of the poplog virtual
        machine.

    primer.ps.gz
        Compressed postcript version of the Pop-11 primer, based on the
        latex formatted version. (May have some formatting oddities).
        About 298 pages (formatted for A4)
    primer2.ps.gz
        This is a "reduced" version printing two pages side by side
        in landscape mode. About 149 pages (A4)

    pophtmlprimer.tar.gz
        Compressed tar file containing the html version of the primer,
        described below. (Note some of the graphical symbols will not
        work, but they are not essential).

    primer/START.html
    ftp://ftp.cs.bham.ac.uk/pub/dist/poplog/primer/START.html
        This provides an HTML version of the primer for direct
        browsing. (It was automatically generated from the Latex
        version and has not been very well formated.)

    A hard copy version of the second edition of the Primer in the
    reduced format is available.
        Price, as of Jan 1999, 8 UK pounds
            Plus postage and packing
                UK      1 pound
                non-UK  3 pounds

        Orders for the Pop-11 Primer should be sent to

TOP LEVEL DIRECTORIES AND TAR FILES:

    auto/
        Autoloadable program files suitable for installation in
        $poplocal/local/auto
        Includes some "fixed" versions of Poplog autoloadable files
        and various extensions, including ved_gn.p for reading
        news in VED (using the Pop11 socket mechanism), ved_texify.p for
        converting Poplog documentation to latex, and many, many more.

    benchmarks/
        Some simple benchmarking test programs in Prolog
        and pop-11 and a summary of results found on a
        variety of machines. (Out of date now: machines have
        become much faster!)

    bhamteachtar.gz
        Tar file with selected Birmingham Pop-11 teaching materials

        This is a compressed tar file containing some of the contents of
        the teach, help, auto and lib subdirectories. This includes
        improved versions of several of the Poplog teach files.
        The contents are listed in the file mklocalteachtar, which
        is used to create the tar file.

        com/mklocalteachtar
            A shell script used to create the bhamteachtar file, showing
            the contents of that file.
    bin/
        Some commands for building tar files, etc.

    com/
        Some shell scripts suitable for $poploca/local/com
        E.g. concerned with building indexes to local directories

    comp.lang.pop.newsgroup
        This is the closest thing there is to a FAQ for the
        comp.lang.pop newsgroup, as far as I know.

    contribtar.gz
        A collection of items forming the Poplog "contrib" directory,
        including the code for the Gazdar and Mellish books on Natural
        Language Processing (Pop-11, Prolog and Lisp versions), Larry
        Paulson's ML tutorial examples, and other useful libraries

    demo/
        Some demonstration programs, including some  produced in
        student projects. We plan to convert these so that they can
        be run without a poplog licence. See
        demo/README

    doc/
        For documentation files and papers on Poplog and Pop-11.
        Includes a paper I wrote around 1989 on the development of
        Poplog and Pop-11 when I was at Sussex University.

    emacs/
        This contains a newly written replacement for the emacs
        interface code originally written by Richard Caley. This
        version is by Brian Logan, at the University of Birmingham
        and uses some of the old code.

        NOTE: even if you use emacs for editing code and driving Poplog
        you may find that it's a good idea to use XVED for examining the
        Poplog online documentation, because the VED graphics characters
        will not look good in Emacs (though Brian's code can cope with
        most of the files).

        You can force the Poplog "help", "teach" and similar commands to
        use xved if your file $poplib/vedinit.p includes the command:
            "x" -> vedusewindows;

    emacstar.gz
        is a compressed tar file containing the contents of the
        emacs/ directory.


    help/
        Corresponding help files suitable for installation in
        $poplocal/local/help

    lib/
        Non-autoloadable program files files suitable for installation
        in $poplocal/local/lib

        Includes some fixed versions of Poplog library files.

    menu/
        The code and documentation for the "recursive hypermenu system"
        an extension to Pop-11 and VED which allows easily extendable
        autoloadable menus for controlling VED and Pop-11, and spawning
        Unix processes etc. using asynchronous control panels.
        A tutorial example is in menu/teach/menu_demo.p

        For details see menu/help/ved_menu. (A slightly out of date
        printable version of that file is menu/hyper.ps.Z)

        Last updated October 1997
        NB the set of autoloadable menus in menu/menus/*.p should be
        regarded as a sample, rather than definitive. Some of the
        examples will not work outside Birmingham as they need local
        libraries (available on request.) These menus should work with
        either motif or Openlook.

        Some of this stuff is superseded by more general facilities in
            rclib/

    menutar.gz
        A compressed tar file containing the contents of the menu/
        and pui/ subdirectories.

    patterntar.gz
        The libraries defining and documenting lib readpattern, and the
        pattern prefix "!" which converts patterns to work with lvars
        and sections. The compressed tar file contains the files
            lib/readpattern.p
            auto/!.p
            help/readpattern
            teach/matches

        The files lib/readpattern.p and auto/!.p if installed in
        $poplocal/local/ extend the Pop-11 pattern matcher so that
        if the prefix "!" is used in front of a pattern, then the
        pattern variables can be used as lvars or as section variables,
        thereby considerably extending the usefulness of the matcher,
        and avoiding bugs, etc.
        This works only in Poplog version 15.0 or later.

        readpattern.tar.gz has been replaced by patterntar.gz


    popvisiontar.gz
        The image manipulation and interpretation library by David Young
        at Sussex University. Includes code and documentation. This may
        not be the latest version, but it includes fixes for linux
        Poplog and Digital unix (alpha) poplog.

    prb/
        Code and documentation for the POPRULEBASE system: a forward-
        chaining condition-action rule interpeter, replacing
        LIB NEWPSYS, with some unusual features described in these
        files:

            prb/teach/poprulebase
            prb/help/poprulebase
            prb/help/rulesystems
            prb/help/prb_filter
        News is in:
            prb/help/prb_news

            Poprulebase is the heart of the Sim_agent toolkit in the
            sim/ directory

    prbtar.gz
        A compressed tar file containing the poprulebase package.

    pui/
        An extension of Poplog's pop_ui facilities, for creation of
        popup menus, file browser, requests for text input, etc.
        Used by the menu/ package. Included in menutar.gz

        Based on Propsheet. Superseded by some of the facilities
        in rclib/ which are more general.


    rclib/
        rclib/auto/
        rclib/help/
        rclib/lib/
        rclib/rclib.p
        rclib/teach/

        Useful object-oriented extensions to the Pop-11 rc_graphic
        library.
        Makes it easy to create movable and rotateable objects in an
        rc_graphic window, and to attach event handlers to objects in
        the window or the window itself, including handlers for mouse
        events (e.g. dragging, clicking) and keyboard events. Live
        buttons and various kinds of menu panels can be added using the
        rc_buttons library, and other interface development aids are
        being added.
        It also includes convenient utilities for changing size or
        location of the graphic window, or its title or colour.
        Library still under development. There's a README file included.

        architectures, described in:

          http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/cog_affect/sim_agent.html

        NB: this requires the poprulebase mechanisms in the prb/
        sub-directory.

        sim/ includes some installation files and several subdirectories

            sim/test

    simtar.gz
        A compressed tar file containing the package, including some
        postscript documentation in the sim/doc directory.
        The prb package is also needed to run sim. The graphical
        examples use the rclib/ libraries.
