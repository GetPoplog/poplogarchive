Oh well -- the goverment has won, and the educational system has lost:
And some short-sighted academics will give a

Instead of a properly designed variably-funded educational system
meeting clearly defined educational needs, MPs have voted for an
educational free-for-all based on market forces, with little or no
chance of a proper review for many years to come -- unless another

<B>Abstract (Added 25 Jan 2004)</B>
<BR>

The letter attempts to point out a number of fallacies in the debates
presented so far, both for and against top-up fees, but above all
stresses the need for a 'joined up' policy on post-school education,
including the need to reintroduce something close to what used to be the
distinction between universities (which would now probably have to be
called
<I>research universities (RUs)</I>) and polytechnics (perhaps now to be
called <I>polytechnic universities (PUs)</I>) so that

<UL>
<LI>school leavers, their teachers, and their parents, have a clear
  understanding of the options available to them,

<LI>employers have a clear understanding of the different sorts of
  qualifications without having to rely on insider knowledge about what
  goes on in different organisations,

<LI> the relative costs of different kinds of education can be properly
  estimated on the basis of educational functions instead of being left
  to market forces managed by amateur business people  (vice
  chancellors and other university managers),
<P>
and

<LI> there are proper career structures for different sorts of academics.
</UL>
<P>
The letter points out that one of the consequences of abolishing the
distinction, exacerbated by steadily worsening staff/student ratios, has
been a serious decline in standards of university teaching over the last
decade. Many university teachers have been demoralised by a serious
decline in the proportion of university students who are suited to the
degree courses they are attending, which leads to a further decline in
standards, which can seriously hold back the most able students -- this
is tragic for them and for the nation.
<P>

The government target of 50% of students going to university makes no
sense without a proper subdivision of the total between different sorts
of university education. The number for research universities should be
much lower. A worthwhile combined target could well be higher than 50%,
especially taking into account the need to cater for people who do not
immediately go into higher education but wish to do so later.
<P>
Both of these categories should be part of a range of types of post
school education distinguished in the letter.

Lynne Jones has rebutted the OECD's arguments in support of the top-up
fee proposals. See
<a href="http://www.poptel.org.uk/lynne.jones/FEESPR.htm">http://www.poptel.org.uk/lynne.jones/FEESPR.htm</a>
<P>
Whilst I agree with her goal of increasing the proportions from lower
socio-economic groups in universities, I think simply aiming for high
target numbers in universities is not the way to do it, and neither is
simply setting quotas for deprived social groups, for reasons given in
my original letter.
<P>
Instead there should be well-funded 'catch up' opportunities to enable
deprived youngsters, and late learners, with promise to show their
mettle. When they have demonstrated that they are up to standard they
can move from the catch-up courses to either Research Universities or
Polytechnic universities, according to the level achieved. Any less
discriminating approach will simply lower standards for everyone.
<P>
The 'Access' courses are supposed to do that, but I have no idea whether
they are properly funded for the job. I suspect not, judging by what I
found when I tried to explore this information site about access
courses:

    <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.uk/access/">http://www.ucas.ac.uk/access/</a>
<BR>
For instance, I found nothing on financial support for deprived students
who wished to catch up. Moreover, most of the courses seemed to be
targeting potential students at Polytechnic universities, rather than
helping deprived high-flyers fulfil their potential. Is this another
well-intentioned but badly thought out initiative?
