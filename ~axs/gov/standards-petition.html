Some extracts from the BBC News report:
<blockquote>
<small>
Standards in science exams in UK schools have been eroded and the
system is failing a generation, the Royal Society of Chemistry
warns.
<p>
In an online petition to Downing Street, the body says
record-breaking exam results are "illusory".
<p>
So far 1,600 people have signed the petition, which complains that
even bright students with enthusiastic teachers have to "learn to
the test".
<p>
The government says standards in science have improved year on year.
<p>
According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, pupils are drilled to
answer "undemanding questions to satisfy the needs of league tables
and national targets".
<p>
They are not learning how to solve problems, use critical thinking
or apply mathematics in science, its petition says.
<br/>
...................
<br/>
Chief executive Richard Pike said: "The target of our campaign is a
failed education system, not the youngsters it's supposed to serve.
<p>
"We know that enthusiastic teachers are being compelled to 'teach to
the test' to meet the demands of school league tables which draws
mainly on the recalling of facts, with no reference to logic or
mathematics.
<p>
"That means the brightest pupils are not being stretched, or trained
in mathematical techniques, because they can get a grade A* without
doing a single calculation.
<p>
"Conversely, the majority get at least a 'good pass' (grade C) by
showing merely a superficial knowledge on a wide range of issues,
but no understanding of the fundamentals. A mark of 20% was
sufficient in one of this summer's GCSE science examinations."

<b>My comment:</b>
<br/>
There might have been earlier recognition of the disastrous nature
of changes in education in the UK, if more government ministers (and
politicians generally) had had professional experience as engineers,
scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers, instead of merely
being career politicians with 'politically correct' and well-meaning
but misguided 'anti-elitist' aspirations
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/elitism.html">(as
explained here)</a>, and had themselves had high quality education
in an intellectually demanding subject, preferably to PhD level
(a lack often revealed by the 'schoolboy-debating' qualities
exhibited in parliament, see
<a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/number-10-tv">clips on number-10-tv</a>
)
<br/>
(My wife used to teach A-Level
science but retired partly in despair at what was happening.)
<p>
I am not saying that ALL politicians should be scientists, etc.,
merely that we need a better balance, especially among
government ministers. There is
<a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/ministerial_responsibilities/assets/lmr_1108.pdf">an official web site</a>
listing government
ministers and their responsibilities, but it does not give their
qualifications.
