Notes on
<a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk">The World Innovation Foundation</a> (WIF)
</b></h3>
In 2004 I was made Fellow of WIF, as indicated
<a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/version2/nlett/25/page4.html"> here
</a>
<br>
I had no idea why I was selected -- I don't seem to belong in the list, as most of the
<br/>
others seem to be Nobel prize-winners and the like.
<br>
<blockquote>
Note added 20 May 2007 (replacing note of 19th April 2007), revised 30 May 2007:
<br>
My WIF Fellowship was temporarily revoked in April 2007, because I raised a question about
<br/>
whether WIF was a hoax, as suggested by one contributor to a Wikipedia administrative
<br/>
discussion. By raising the question I hoped to find answers. However the only person who
<br/>
noticed my question was the chief executive of the WIF, who was not pleased. (However, he
<br/>
later withdrew his condemnation.)
<p>
My (not very extensive) investigations eventually led me to the conclusion that WIF was
<br/>
not a hoax. Moreover, the unsupportable claim on various web sites that WIF had been
<br/>
founded by Glen Seaborg in 1992 which had raised <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive137#World_Innovation_Foundation">suspicions</a> in the minds of some
wikipedia
<br/>
discussants was not made by WIF itself, but by careless press officers in universities,
<br/>
who compressed two separate facts
<blockquote>
(a) that WIF was
founded (with a different name) in 1992, and
<br>
(b) that Glen Seaborg became its founding President when the name was changed, at his
<br/>
suggestion, in 1996, shortly before he died.
</blockquote>
So, I conclude that WIF is real and serious, and it is not a hoax, but as far as I can
<br/>
tell, most of its fellows are proud to be elected, but do nothing for WIF, and at this
<br/>
stage it is not clear to me that WIF is capable of realising its lofty ambitions, and the
<br/>
extent of its influence is not clear. However the Chief Executive, Dr. David Hill and
<br/>
others associated with the WIF do give invited addresses at some conferences, though these
<br/>
do not seem to attract much attention. That conclusion was reached after a short period of
<br/>
intermittent investigation in the first third of 2007, and may have been based on
<br/>
insufficient evidence. Even if true at the time, it could prove misleading if the WIF
<br/>
manages to attract more resources for its work.
