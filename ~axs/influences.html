of logical geography and logical
topography.
<li>
<a href="http://www.utilitarian.net/hare/">Richard Mervyn Hare</a>
<blockquote>
He was my "personal tutor" at Balliol College Oxford, after I
switched from mathematics and logic to philosophy. He was very kind
to me personally, including inviting me to join him, his family, and
his students on a trip to Plas Rhoscolyn in Anglesey, and giving me
some of his time to discuss philosophy, despite my being fairly
ignorant of most philosophy. He eventually even trusted me to give
tutorials on moral philosophy to some of his students, while I was
working on my D.Phil.
<p>
I also went to lectures and seminars by other Moral philosophers in
Oxford, including Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot, both of whom
disagreed strongly with Hare's meta-ethics. Although I liked and
admired both, I thought then, and think now, that Hare was more
right than they were: they both struck me as being guilty of wishful
thinking, since they did not like the conclusions of his arguments
and tended to use scorn rather than reason in opposing him. But I
also thought Hare guilty of wishful thinking in supposing that his
prescriptivist analysis of "good" and "ought" could provide a basis
for arguing rationally against fanatics like Hitler or South African
white supremacists.
<p>
I later concluded that "better" was the most basic concept and wrote
<a href="my-doings.html#better">some papers</a>
on the implications of treating "better" as a sort of
logical operator with multiple arguments.

<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/sloman-clowestribute.html">Max Clowes</a>
<br/>
Who introduced me to AI, around 1969, and pushed me to write
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/sloman-analogical-1971/">my first AI paper</a>
in 1971.
<li>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>
<br/>
Who was wrong about many things, but right about the need to
consider many different sorts of examples when considering a
philosophical problem. In his ability to do that, he seems to have
been unmatched.
<li>
There have been many other colleagues and friends from whom I have
learnt/benefitted in various ways. One day I may try to produce a list, to say
thanks. This would include all the contributors to:
