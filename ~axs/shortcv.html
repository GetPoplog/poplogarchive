Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). After a degree in
mathematics and physics at Cape Town (1956) won a Rhodes Scholarship to
<a href="https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/">Balliol College</a>,
Oxford 1957-60, to study mathematics. Became more interested in logic,
then Philosophy of mathematics, and switched to philosophy. Senior Scholar at
<a href="https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/">St Antony's College</a>
1960-62.
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/sloman-1962">(DPhil
completed 1962)</a>.
For my last two years in Oxford I was a Senior Scholar at St Antony's College.
<p>
Lecturer in philosophy of science at Hull university, 1962-4, then moved to
University of Sussex 1964-91, apart from a year (1972-3) in Edinburgh converting
to AI, as a result of a paper criticising Logicist AI at IJCAI 1971. At Sussex
helped to start undergraduate courses in AI and later the School of Cognitive
and Computing Sciences. Helped with development of the Pop-11 programming
language the Poplog development environment and much AI teaching material.
GEC-funded research professor 1984-6. Moved to Birmingham University as
reluctant head of school 1991. (Ceased headship 1994). Officially retired 2002
but continued doing research as Honorary Professor of AI and Cognitive science.
<br/>
1991: Elected fellow of AAAI (Association for the Advancement of AI)

<h3> BIOGRAPHY </h3>

<blockquote>
Born in Que Que (now KweKwe), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe),
1936.
<br/>
<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?source=embed&saddr=-18.931882,29.804937&daddr=&hl=en&geocode=&mra=mi&mrsp=0&sz=18&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=210111324766800093229.00046a71e1312c65e4076&t=h&ll=-18.937464,29.816895&spn=8.099548,13.106689&z=7&vpsrc=6">Here's a map with annotations (zoom in and click)</a>
<br />
Went to school there till 1948 then school (SACS) and
university (UCT) in Cape Town
<br/>
(BSc mathematics and physics 1956 1st class).
<br />
Won
a Rhodes Scholarship (SACS constituency) and went to Oxford (Balliol College,
October 1957) to study mathematics, but eventually got seduced by philosophy
after toying with mathematical logic for while, and was allowed to do a DPhil
defending Kant's philosophy of mathematics (thesis now online):
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/sloman-1962">(DPhil
1962)</a>. For my last two years in Oxford I was a Senior Scholar at St Antony's
College.
<br/>
(I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hao_Wang">Hao Wang</a> as supervisor while studying
mathematical logic, then David Pears
after I switched to philosophy -- I don't think he was very interested in what I was
doing. Richard M. Hare was my 'Personal Tutor' at Balliol. We got on very well and I
learnt a lot from him, and, for a while, helped with some of his philosophy
tutoring.)
<p>
Started teaching Philosophy at Hull University in 1962, then moved to Sussex in 1964.
Spent 1972-3 in Edinburgh as Senior Visiting Fellow, and was converted to "AI as the best
way to do philosophy." I learnt more that year than in any other year of my life since
about the age of 4.
<p>

Returned to Sussex October 1973, and helped (with Max Clowes, Margaret Boden, Alistair
Chalmers, then later Steve Hardy, John Lyons, Gerald Gazdar and others) to develop a
Cognitive Studies Programme in the School of Social Sciences which eventually grew into
the Sussex School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences. (SOCS)
<p>

<!--New Page-->
Over the years dabbled in vision (perhaps
the hardest unsolved problem in AI, psychology and
neuroscience), the study of forms of representation, motivation and emotion, architectures
for complete agents, how to build a mathematician (starting at about age 3 or 4), design
of robots of the future, the evolution of powerful learning strategies, trajectories in
design space and niche space, philosophical problems about mind, emotion, mathematics,
causation and meta-ethics, and good ways to teach novices programming and AI, and how to
make computing the centre of a new kind of liberal education -- an aim defeated by
politics, economics, lack of suitable teachers, and the presence of the wrong sorts of
computer systems in schools all round the world. (For more see
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/my-doings.html">my 'my-doings' file.</a>)
<p>
Managed the development of Poplog, a sophisticated multi-language design environment, for
exploratory research and teaching in AI and Cognitive Science, at Sussex between about
1980 and 1991. <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html"> (Find out more about it here).</a>
Poplog won a UK Government 'SMART' award for Integral Solutions Ltd around 1991 for
achieving sales of over 5 million dollars, and was the basis of the development of
<a href="http://www.spss.com/clementine/"> Clementine</a> among other commercial products.
Poplog is now a <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">free open source system</a>. I manage the web site.
<P>
Obtained grants for development of poplog, and for research in vision. In 1984-6 was
awarded a GEC Research Fellowship (not applied for). Grants from the Renaissance Trust
supported my work.
<P>

After 27 years at Sussex wanted a change so moved to Birmingham in 1991, when offered a
research chair. Foolishly agreed (under strong pressure from VC) to be Head of School of
Computer Science at first, but in 1994 became a research professor, working on
architectures for human-like agents, a toolkit for exploring agent architectures,
motivation, emotion, vision, causation, consciousness and related problems. Passed UK
academic retirement age in 2001 but have continued to work full time, living on pension!
<P>
Grants from the UK Joint Council initiative on HCI, the Renaissance Trust, DERA, the
Leverhulme trust, and the EC have supported this research.

Prompted by Linda World, who was writing
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/misc/linda-world-ieee-0508.pdf">
an article </a> about me
for the 'Histories and Futures'
section of <I>IEEE Intelligent Systems</I> (published July/August 2005),
I started to assemble
a hypertext summary of
<a href="my-doings.html">things I've done and worked on</a>.
<p>
Inspired by reading Turing on Morphogenesis in 2011, started the Meta-Morphogenesis
project to unify many things I had previously been working on.
