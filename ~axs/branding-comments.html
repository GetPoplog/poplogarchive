I was at an EC workshop recently and mentioned the re-branding that had
been going on here. It turns out that universities all over the place
are doing it. Why???? It seems that the main justification is that other
universities are doing it, and doing it is seen as a (futile?) attempt
to do better than the others, whereas the net result can only be
everyone standing still at great expense to the taxpayer. Just think how
much more could be achieved if instead of making marketing companies
richer all that money had been put into improving lecture room or
laboratory furnishings and facilities, or improving course materials, or
even replacing useless roller towels in toilets by electric hand driers
in departments where people work all day every day round the year (so
that roller towels are often disgusting and unhygienic because there is
nobody to replace them most of the time.)
<P>
It's very sad, especially when we reflect that apart from the marginal
once-only cost of each such rebranding exercise, there is all the
ongoing expenditure, space, and other resource-consumption by marketing
departments in universities trying to catch each others tails. I wonder
what would happen if, instead, all that funding went into increasing the
size of academic staff who were then encouraged to produce good
documentation and web sites on their teaching and research. (This could
be made a contractual part of their job.)
<P>
Another example: my university produces a regular news sheet in which
one of the highlights is a column called 'Spin cycle' which lists names
of people who have talked to reporters or journalists or been
interviewed on the radio or TV.... Who cares, apart from the people who
work in press offices? Why don't they instead produce a weekly column
listing new ideas that have been produced that week by
researchers (and students) in the university? That would show that we
are a real university, not an appendage to a marketing team.

I have found that giving google the string "waste re-branding" produces
36,700 results. As an example, this site, near the top of the list, is
short and pithy
<a href="http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/12/25/story34330.asp">http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/12/25/story34330.asp</a>
<br>
It starts thus:

<P>
<blockquote>
Rebranding 'can be waste of time'
<P>
10:48:32 AM
<P>
Companies can be wasting both time and money if they just change their
name to re-brand themselves, according to a marketing expert.
<P>
A corporate name change has to go in tandem with a change of identity,
or it can be an expensive waste of time, says Tom Blackett, deputy
chairman of Interbrand.
<P>
Rebranding is often perceived as a cynical attempt by a company to boost
its share price or shrug off the past.
</blockquote>
Here is another link showing what happens when people who don't
understand what they are doing start re-branding things:

In possibly one of the shortest-lived rebranding exercises in history,
Tony Blair has given in to criticism of the DTI's renaming as the
Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry (DPEI) by reinstating
its original title.
<P>
As part of the prime minister's announcements for his new government,
the Department of Trade and Industry was renamed the DPEI in an effort
to encourage more focus on business productivity.
<P>
But the move was met with disdain from business groups which expressed
concern of the removal of 'trade' from the department's title.

I have just stumbled across the
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/08/21/brummies_goes_brand_barmy/">Brummies goes brand barmy</a>
web site, which at first I thought must be some satirical or sarcastic
comment on the University's recent re-branding mania.
<P>
Not at all: it seems that the city of Birmingham got there first -- with
the same sorts of vapid justificatory statements and the same evidence
among the re-branders
that they really understand what they are doing.
<P>
So how come I live in Birmingham and never even noticed when it all
happened?
<P>
Perhaps rebranding exercises of large, complex, multi-faceted, entities
fall into only two categories: those that go unnoticed because they are
of no consequence and have no impact at all, and those whose main impact
is to provoke anger, annoyance, irritation, etc., among people who are
fairly directly affected by the consequences.
<P>

Someone recently complained that the administrators were dictating how
we are permitted to format business cards, including stipulating that
job description MUST come above name. etc etc.
<P>
It is clear that some of these people do not understand the difference
between a university and a bank or insurance company.
<P>
There are many indications in the behaviour of the administrators and
senior managers over this and other issues, and the defences for the
rebranding given on the bham branding web site
<a
href="http://www.general.bham.ac.uk/brand/">http://www.general.bham.ac.uk/brand/</a>

that make it clear that the administrators concerned have no conception
of the requirements for a world class collegiate university, where the
notion of a uniform brand is totally irrelevant to the diversity,
adventurousness, and freedom to disagree that should be present in any
such university.
<P>
Instead they are steeped in trendy but inappropriate notions of
'corporate management' and at best understand the requirements for
catching the eyes of shoppers scanning supermarket shelves when making
trivial purchases.
<P>
If I were at an earlier stage of my career I would now be thinking about
moving to a university that is managed differently -- unless this one
begins to budge.
<P>
Of course Birmingham is not the only university where the brains of
administrators have been addled by too much contact with people whose
expertise was designed for a different kind of world.
<P>
Aston, Brighton Poly (now university) and Sussex were mentioned in
previous discussions in this school, and I learnt over the weekend that
Imperial College went through a similar (but apparently even more
expensive) process about three years ago much to the disgust of many
academics and many students (see the pattern?). I was assured by my
informant that it had been a completely useless waste of money and time.
<P>
It was interesting to see that both at IC and here, one of the recurring
student objections was that rebranding made the place look more like a
polytechnic -- an interesting kind of snobbery common to both lots of
students, but perhaps reflecting some understanding of the differences
of function of different kinds of higher education institutions ignored
by the re-branders.
<P>
My colleague threatened to get cards printed externally and paid for
privately to meet the requirements of the job to be done in the light of
the likely external contacts to whom they would be given, and their
needs and expectations.
<P>
My response was:
<P>
You should not have to do that. The <I>School</I> should support you and
others who wish to do this.
<P>
We have gone it alone over other issues where central management had
made deep mistakes (remember the School's vote regarding the compulsory
PGCE?) and shown that we were right.
<P>
As a School we should be prepared to do that as often as needed, so long
as in doing so we are willing to justify our action in a court of law,
in the press, and in statements to taxpayers, students, research
collaborators and potential funders.
<P>
The point is that as public servants and members of educational and
research communities we have obligations that go far beyond serving our
employers. (Especially when those employers become dictatorial.)
<P>
[I could have added: and who completely fail to understand
risk-management, always covering their backs legally instead of trying
as best they can to enable us to achieve educational and research
goals.]
<P>
If necessary, an emergency school meeting could be called to authorise
the expenditure if nobody is in a position to do it without that.
<P>
The notion that in a *university* central management should dictate what
goes on our letters, business cards, memo paper, web sites, etc., as if
we were a some kind of commercial company is totally outrageous.

Someone recently wrote to me
<PRE>
> I agree whole-heartedly with your comment that team-building (between
> different types of staff) is a critical aspect of creating a dynamic and
> effective University.
</PRE>

<H3><B>
My reply follows:
</B></H3>

I have a list of ways (minor and major) in which the separation of
important decision-making from the people who have a lifelong commitment
to the teaching and research causes harm in this university.
<P>
It got worse when faculties were abolished in the 90s. Many of the
faculty committees and sub-committees used to be time-wasting talking
shops, so they were abolished in the interests of efficiency.
<P>
Few people involved in that decision seemed to appreciate, as some
protesters pointed out, that the baby was going down the drain: the
'inefficient' meetings had a most important unintended side-effect,
namely bringing people from different schools and departments, including
youngish members of staff, together and often enabling them to get to
know administrators who would otherwise be dark faces behind the scenes.
<P>
If you meet people in a committee, you may start talking to them in the
staff canteen, etc. etc.
<P>
Nothing was done to rescue the baby, as far as I know.
<P>
Having a professional class whose decision-making has too much autonomy,
and whose main professional loyalty is 'upwards', however dedicated and
hard working they may be, instead of being primarily committed to trying
to understand the needs (and sometimes prejudices) of the academics
responsible for the university's main functions, is a long term recipe
for malaise.
<P>
Like having a medical service aiming at meeting government targets
instead of serving patients.
<P>
No amount of rebranding (gimmicky or not) will undo the harm caused by
such an arrangement, which I suspect is a deep cause of problems in
recruitment of staff or students.
<P>
Shallow marketing may generate a flurry of interest, but doesn't fix
problems. Deep marketing investigates what is wrong with the product,
and tries to re-shape it so that on the one hand its content becomes
more attractive and on the other hand the results lead to a reputation
for excellence.
<P>
The latter is much harder and requires a deep understanding of what
people are doing right and doing wrong, which alas, does not come out of
the justifications given for the rebranding, including the utterly
ridiculous claims about how our 'key values' are unique, which could
only come from people with no understanding of the university system.
<P>
It is not surprising that work done by such people managed to alienate
so many staff and and students, leaving XXX with the task of undoing the
damage, which never should have been caused in the first place.
<P>
I know I am thought of as a trouble-making critic of the university. In
fact I have spent a huge amount of my time since coming here in 1991
trying to turn this into a world class university (not just 'the best in
the midlands'), and the change in the school of computer science in that
period is one piece of evidence that I know something about the process.
Other things are not so visible.
<P>
(Much of what I know was learnt from my mentor, Gerry Martin, one of the
founders of Eurotherm and other companies, who died last year, alas.)
<P>
 From the start I found the process very difficult because of the way
the university was managed, and the lack of a deep culture of mutual
understanding and cooperation across the university, apart from a few
outstanding individuals.
<P>
A culture can be very hard to change, unfortunately, especially when its
most important features are 'invisible' to most of those concerned.
<P>
Moreover, as my web-page on the rebranding exercise points out,
changing this culture will require the younger academics to put more
effort into activities they don't inherently enjoy and which, in the RAE
era, involves serious career risks.
<P>
So change is very difficult, like turning a huge tanker in narrow
straits. It can be done, if the will is there, and the problems are
understood. Repainting the tanker will not help.
<P>
Best wishes.

Apologies to all concerned: there has been a <I>lot</I> of discussion in the
school since I first wrote my
<a href="branding.html">notes on the re-branding exercise</a>,
but I have been too busy with other things to find out exactly what the
discussants wished me to make public here as I had originally planned to
do.
<P>
I'll be happy to add comments if anyone submits them to me with a
specific request to do so.
<P>
One thing that has come out of the discussion is that in spite of a lot
of dissatisfaction with the process and its outcome there are a few
things that are generally liked, such as these two:
<UL>
  <LI>
  <a href="logos/cs-blue.png">blue</a>

  <LI>
  <a href="logos/cs-white.png">white</a>
</UL>
But it's obvious that entertaining images like that could have been
produced to illustrate our documents without all the other expensive and
controversial changes.
<P>
An example of the totally uninformed thinking behind the rebranding is
the statement on page 1 of
<a href="http://www.general.bham.ac.uk/brand/images/BG_04_provoke.pdf">this document</a>
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>
Any university can teach facts. But we want to provoke people to reason
for themselves, to question and to create impact. This is what makes the
University of Birmingham unique.
</I>
</blockquote>
How on earth could senior managers have accepted that statement? Maybe
this is an example of the very sort of complacency that our market
researchers discovered was thought to be characteristic of the
University of Birmingham. (Well, some parts of it anyway!)
The statement
shows complete ignorance of the university system at large and
how this university relates to it. If its author studied at
a university it must have been a <I>very</I> bad one.
<P>
Moreover, I completely
disagree with the statement on page 3 that
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>
All our messages should be confident, simple and straightforward.
</I>
</blockquote>
That may be appropriate to selling a relatively cheap product to anyone
who has money to buy, but is inappropriate when we are not trying to
maximise the <I>number</I> of applicants, but trying to maximise the
number of <I>high quality</I> applicants. This is understood well by
some 'hi tech' companies who put subtle and complex intellectual
challenges on their recruitment web pages. The latter is the approach I
adopted when I wrote the original prospectus entries that enabled us to
launch our AI degree, which enabled us to grow at a time when most CS
departments in the UK were competing with one another to attract
students from a fixed pool of not very high quality students.
Unfortunately our wording was later dumbed-down by marketing experts,
for a while.
<P>
One of the comments posted within the school pointed out that the
rebranded material had gone down well on opening days. This could be a
result of something close to the well-known
<a href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/history/hawthorne.html">`Hawthorne
effect'</a>, explained and analysed in more detail
<a href="http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/hawth.html">here.</a>
One
<a href="http://www.burtonreport.com/InfHealthCare/Info&UseHawthorne.html"> summary of the effect</a>
states
<blockquote>
<I>
....by merely participating in a test, trial or study the
participants (or patients) have a better experience because of the
focusing of interest toward them which is gratifying and thus rewarding
in its own sake.  For this reason the persons involved document better
results irregardless of the change provided or the treatment
experienced.
</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
If the people preparing publicity material thought they were part of a
re-branding exercise that belief might have stimulated them to put more
effort into how they prepared materials for students, the wording used,
etc. Whether the same effect on applicants would have been produced had
the same <I>content</I> been presented with the old
<I>brand</I> (e.g. logo, marque, and ubiquitous, and
some think ridiculous "U B" brackets) would require impossible research.
<P>
Perhaps the university managers and the marketing consultants know all
about the Hawthorne effect and have been deliberately using it???? In
that case the effort could have been re-focused onto much better use of
the web to present deep, challenging, contentful accounts of our
teaching and research, which would have been indexed by search engines,
possibly leading intellectually adventurous people all round the world
using modern technology to look for information to find this university.
Instead, the re-branding has focused mainly on techniques more
appropriate to the age of paper. Doing it properly might have meant
abandoning the straight-jacket formats related to teaching quality
assurance processes which are more appropriate to training colleges
than universities!
<P>

I have just noticed
<a href="http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/marijke/lionmermaid.html">these comments</a>
by a researcher in the School of Mathematics & Statistics.

<BR>
I dislike the crest as being old-fashioned and pseudo, claiming an ancient
tradition when there is none.  I think that the new logo has the merit of
being an attempt at being new, crisp and clean.  However, I agree with
many other people who have said that it is a bit facile, and lacks
consistency. I think the new brand is only marginally better than the old
one.
<P>

> They are going back to an even older crest for some purposes.
<P>
That seems ridiculous to me. The idea that they should reinstate the old
brand as something prestigious that the bosses can use (HoS upwards) while
ordinary staff have to use what is perceived as the inferior new brand is
surely madness.  What better way could there be of reinforcing the dislike
of the new brand, while also guaranteeing further resentment among
lower-paid staff?

Note by original author:
</I>
<BR>
Thanks to Mark Ryan for pointing out some typos in the hastily written
original version of my document.
<P>
After looking at the pictures of the old crest, which has now been
(partially) reinstated, I can see why the previous marketing consultants
(some time in the late 1980s?) were probably wise in recommending that
we drop it, because it includes Latin text "Per Ardua Ad Alta" that very
few people will understand nowadays, which is therefore somewhat
patronising. In any case it is not unique to UoB. It is also very close
to the motto of the Royal Air Force, to which it is perhaps more
appropriate,

<P>

It occurs to me that a really bright way to abandon links with
irrelevant ancient heraldry might have been to devise a new graphical
logo derived from either the clock tower or the front of the Aston Webb
building, or both.
But many modern artists are not taught the relevant skills, I
believe.

<P>
At least it is not as awful and outdated as Oxford's motto "Dominus
Illuminatio Mea" in a secular age. Who will bet on one or other of
these:
<br>
(a) Oxford University taking steps to replace its crest and motto?
<br>
(b) Oxford University losing good students and job applicants because it
fails to re-brand?
