<small>
A related paper is under construction on the task of explaining how a genome
specifies not just structures but also control mechanisms, including ancient
spatial reasoning mechanisms capable of making ancient discoveries in geometry
and topology possible. This will complement the above paper summarising
Schr&ouml;dinger's argument in <i>What is life?</i>(1944) about the importance
of quantum physics in explaining the amazing reliability of biological
reproduction, without which life as we know it would be impossible. I'll suggest
(tentatively) that without use of quantum physical mechanisms controlling
sub-neural molecular processes, mathematical discoveries in geometry and in
every day spatial reasoning would have been impossible.

"Today, thanks to the ingenious work of biologists, mainly of
geneticists, during the last thirty or forty years, enough is
known about the actual material structure of organisms and
about their functioning to state that, and to tell precisely why,
present-day physics and chemistry could not possibly account
for what happens in space and time within a living organism."

APOLOGIES FOR MESS
<br>
This page badly needs reorganisation
<br/>
<small>
My web pages started soon after the internet began, around 1992.
Available tools were very primitive for a long time, and later
I was too busy to do anything about reorganising the pages.
An attempt to get external funding to help reorganise it was unsuccessful.

When asked to comment on impact in a reference:
</b>
<small>
<br/>
<i>What should I write if asked to act as an academic
referee, and
the invitation requests me to assess the impact of the candidate's
work?</i>
<p>-</p>
My expanded notes on this topic can be found <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/research-impact.html">here.</a>
<br/>
What follows is an older, simpler, response.
<br/>
<blockquote>
<small>
    "I am not interested in impact, only quality of research, which does
    not always correlate with impact, since the latter is often subject
    to fashion and transient funding policies, etc. If you want a study
    of impact you would do better to consult a social scientist.
    Moreover high impact as measured by citations is often a consequence of making
    mistakes that many other people comment on.
<p>
Many great research achievements could not possibly be assessed
for their impact until
many years later, in some cases long after the death of the researcher
(e.g.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>).
<p>
    I'll tell you what I think about the research quality: things like
    the depth, difficulty, and importance of the questions addressed,
    the originality, clarity, precision and explanatory power of the
    theories developed, and how well they fit known facts, as far as I
    can tell. If there are engineering products I may have some comments
    on their contribution to research. I shall not be able to evaluate
    their contribution to wealth or happiness."
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Researchers and teachers should not allow themselves to be dictated
to by managers following the latest managerial fashions.</b>
</small>
</div>

<div class="boxed">
<small>
<small>
It never ceases to amaze me that neither senior academics in
universities, nor senior administrators in funding agencies, nor senior
politicians, can see the huge wastefulness in trying to make major
service organisations funded by the nation put substantial resources
into behaviour that is comparable to a group of monkeys all struggling
to be near the food at the top of a greasy pole.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of contributing to all that wasted effort, they should be
cooperating to produce a national system of research and education that,
among other things, provides the best possible opportunities for all
young minds with academic potential to be stretched to their limits, and
(with international collaboration) pushes research frontiers in as many
directions as possible: for we never know where new knowledge gems lie
in wait.
<br/>
<br/>
If funds available nationally for research can't support all the
academics needed for teaching then there should be a higher proportion
of teaching oriented institutions (e.g. polytechnics), along with a
weighted, dynamically adjusted lottery for research funding, as
described <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/lottery.html">here</a>

NOTE ON SECURITY:
<br/>
<small>
For <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/security.html">various
reasons</a> it is absolutely impossible to build
systems that can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.
So researchers in the field must make clear to politicians,
purchasers, research funders, and the general public that whatever
systems they use, there is always a risk of security failure and all
decisions to use such systems must take account of that risk, and
the consequences and costs of security failure.
<br/>
In some cases it may be better not to go ahead with a project whose
success depends on a guarantee of perfect security, but to do
something less ambitious -- e.g. aim for something less uniform, or
less integrated.
<br/>
It is clear that there were members of the previous government who
failed to understand these points. (One consequence is the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/isoft">NHS IT
fiasco</a>)
<br/>
I don't know whether the current
coalition includes people who do understand the issues.

SAVING THE UK ALVEY PROGRAMME FROM DISASTER?

<br>
The Committee appointed Angelica Agredo Montealegre, a PhD student at King's
College London, as a Specialist Adviser to conduct research into historic
Government policy on artificial intelligence.
<br>
The appendix includes this little reminder of how I helped avoid a disaster for
AI research in the UK:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>
"The Alvey programme was a five-year collaborative R&D programme in IT which
began in 1983. It was funded by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the
Science Engineering Research Council (SERC) and the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
In total the programme cost #350 million (approximately #1 billion today), of
which #200 million came from the Government and the remainder from industry.
A further source of problems for the Alvey programme was related to the support
it attempted to provide for the British computing industry. Although the
programme was meant to contribute to the UK's competitiveness in the sector
through pre-competitive research, measures were taken to advance this goal more
directly. This assistance took two forms: capital purchases and small firm
participation. At the beginning of the programme, the Alvey Directorate decided
to make bulk purchases of British computing equipment. Buying the same equipment
for the participants was meant to facilitate communication between different
research projects."
</i>
<br>
.....
<p>
<i>
"However, not everyone involved with the Alvey programme agreed with the
decision
to buy British equipment, with some voicing concerns about quality. Even Mr
Oakley later admitted that these purchasing decisions were, in hindsight, "an
expensive mistake".618 Aaron Sloman, Professor of AI and Cognitive Science at
the University of Sussex, cited it as an error that should be avoided in future
programmes, in his letter to Sir Austin Bide in 1986: "[this mistake was]
forcing people to use totally unsuitable hardware and software just because it
is British, thereby holding up significant research and diverting precious
highly skilled manpower from advanced research to low-level software
development".
</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The report does not mention that partly as a result of my letter (originally
addressed to the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who passed it on...) it was
decided that instead of choosing the GEC-63 computer as the sole or main vehicle
for AI research in the Alvey Project, it would buy a small number of the
machines (which were not yet reliably usable!) to be given to a few AI research
groups, in order to test the machine's abilities.
That included our group at Sussex University, which had developed the Poplog
multi-language development environment, which was already being used in academe
and industry on computers made in the USA, and a UK Unix workstation
(Bleasdale): (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplog">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplog</a>)
</p>
<p>
In addition, for the main AI research projects funded by Alvey, other already
functional workstations and time-shared computers were provided, which enabled
researchers in industry and academe to make progress, including using AI
software developed in the USA, when appropriate.
</p>
<p>
I recall one of the industrial users of the GEC computer telling me that every
time there was a new update for the firmware, they booted up the computer,
installed the firmware, and left it running till it crashed, then turned it off.
There were also reports that it made a good heater.
</p>
<p>
At the time I was on a two year research fellowship funded by GEC, so I half
expected my fellowship to be cancelled. I received a phone call from a senior
manager at GEC. He was very polite and listened carefully as I explained to him
that expecting highly paid researchers to make progress using that machine in
its current state would be a complete waste of their time. I suggested that GEC
should tell the group developing the machine that they should get it fully
working by a certain date, and if they failed they should cancel the project.
I believe that's what happened a few months later. I did not receive any
official thanks from GEC for saving them money and embarrassment, but was
grateful that my fellowship was allowed to run to completion!
</p>
<b>A gap in the summary</b>
<br>
The summary states:
<blockquote>
<i>
In the 1980s, the UK AI research community coined its own term for AI:
Intelligent Knowledge Based Systems (IKBS). IKBS described "systems which
combine hardware and software in order to achieve the goal of using inference to
apply knowledge to perform a task".598 However, `AI' was still used, especially
when referring to `Expert Systems'-computer systems that attempt to emulate the
decision-making of a human by using a set of facts and rules that had been
previously programmed into them.
</i>
</blockquote>
This comment really applies only to the Alvey report and its main proposers.
They were strongly influenced by the focus of the Japanese 5th Generation
project on Logic and parallelism. The proposers tried to direct attention to a
subset of AI and that seems to have been the main reason for not using the label
"Artificial Intelligence" for the proposal: instead they invented the bigger
mouthful IKBS (defined above) -- which I deliberately always replaced with "AI".
However when deciding what to do with the report the Science Research Council
convened a meeting (or perhaps more than one) and invited a wider variety of AI
researchers than the authors of the report. I was included and objected to what
seemed to me to be a narrow focus, in particular I and others urged that the
project should be expanded to include research on vision and language as parts
of human-like intelligence, rather than merely technologies for interfaces
between humans and machines -- the roles they were given in the original Alvey
report (unless I've misremembered). The Alvey report emphasising IKBS  focused
heavily on the use of logic (echoing the Japanese Fifth Generation computer
project), which some of us thought narrowed the field too much. The report
mentioned vision and speech in the context of human machine interfaces, rather
than as core aspects of intelligence. Anyhow, as a result of various
discussions, the scope was expanded and an Alvey Vision Club was formed. See,
for example,
<a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/bmvc/avc1988">https://dblp.org/db/conf/bmvc/avc1988</a>
There was also expansion to include speech understanding.
The eventual breadth of the Alvey Programme is clearly
indicated here:

Brian Oakley, director of the Alvey project, wrote a book reflecting on the
project: <i>Alvey: Britain's Strategic Computing Initiative</i>, MIT
Press, 1990
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>
<br>
The long term aim of the Alvey Programme was to contribute to the wealth of the
UK through technological advances. My own interest was mainly concerned with
attempting to use AI as a <i>scientific</i> and <i>philosophical</i> research
activity, concerned with attempting to understand how <i>natural</i>
intelligence works. That work continues in the Turing-inspired
Meta-Morphogenesis (M-M) project,
begun (unfunded) during the Turing Centenary year
(2012):
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/meta-morphogenesis.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/meta-morphogenesis.html</a>
<br>
I now suspect that there are aspects of natural intelligence, including spatial
intelligence and ancient forms of mathematical discovery, that depend crucially
on sub-neural chemistry-based brain mechanisms that cannot be modelled properly
using digital computers. This is already a factor seriously limiting the spatial
intelligence of robots (e.g. compared with squirrels, crows, and human
toddlers). I do not believe that currently popular ways of thinking about and
doing AI can deal with those gaps, which the M-M project aims to specify more
more depth than this document. There is evidence that Alan Turing was aware of
the need for something more general than digital computation:

ON CRUEL AND UNFAIR REWARD-BASED GOVERNMENT (30 Apr 2008)
</b>
<object>
<p>
BBC Radio 4 discussion 'Start the week', led by Andrew
Marr, made the point that weaker nations cannot compete fairly with
the rich ones, and so a global economy based on free market
principles does not help everyone equally, and can do serious harm
to poorer nations.
</p>
<p>
A related argument is usually ignored in countries like the UK, in
which recent governments have followed a policy of applying a market
economy to public service organisations (schools, universities,
hospitals, etc) by transferring funds from ones lower down league
tables to the ones nearer the top. This ignores the fact that the
process of competition to select winners sits heavily on the
shoulders of ordinary people who cannot easily take their business
elsewhere, e.g. students and children who are not being taught well,
sick people who are not being treated well, etc. So, like the
decision to bomb a country to make things better, which disregards
all the harm done to civilians in the process, attempts to use a
market economy by setting targets and transferring resources to the
public service institutions that do well, disregards the harm done
to individual users of those institutions by the results of such
competition.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is the unfashionable idea of (a) trying to ensure
that the highest possible standards and rigorous selection processes
are used when those organisations hire, or promote staff, or decide
who has satisfied probationary requirements, and in addition (b)
setting up monitoring and management systems and putting resources
into the parts that need to do better rather than simply
rewarding the ones that do well.
</p>
<p>
Our government's policy of transferring resources to the
organisations that do well is like a policy of looking after a
massive ocean platform or
bridge by monitoring its support pylons and then putting resources
into extending the ones that are doing well.
</p>
<p>
How to improve selection processes and how to do the monitoring and
management needed to bring all up to a high standard are topics for
another day. My argument here is that the notion that it can be done
by a market economy is both bad management and cruel to the people
for whom the services exist.

NO TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT FREELY AND QUICKLY AVAILABLE
(OPEN ACCESS) LITERATURE

<p>
As I get older and the time left for reading and learning gets
shorter, while the rate of production of research material in many
disciplines, all around the world, continues to increase (including
a significant proportion of very good stuff), my motivation for
reading anything that is not freely available on the internet has
been falling rapidly. I feel I no longer have time to go to get hold
of paper books and journals that are not likely to provide anything
more interesting than the many still unread freely and quickly
available electronic materials, especially as when I read the latter
I can change the font size to suit my long-sighted eyes, and I don't
need to hold a tome in my hand, nor do I have to manually transcribe
bits of text on which I want to make notes, or send comments, since
I can use copy and paste, nor do I have to carry with me the paper
documents I may want to read while travelling. I know that not
everyone feels this way, but that's fine with me.
</p>
<p>
For the benefit of others who share this preference I have been
making all my own publications freely available, including drafts
that can be improved in response to critical comments. I see no
reason why publications need to be frozen in a printed format.

windows do not allow me to work as I wish. Some of the reasons are explained in

      There is no need for a school or university to imprison young minds in a

        have started to change in UK schools since around 2012. Unfortunately
        there still seems to be little understanding of the importance of
        teaching bright young learners to use the techniques of symbolic AI.
        Computer education, like many other aspects of education, can be impacted
        by bad fashions.

          There is much talk now of basing research evaluation on research and
          contract income.
          <br/>
          People should be reminded of what Roger Needham said when he chaired
          <br/>
          the computing panel for the UK Research Assessment Exercise:
          <br/>
          'We are interested in the quality of the strawberries, not the
          amount of manure.'

<h1>THE DESIGN-BASED APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF MIND</h1>
<small>
When scientists discuss experimental observations,
they often, unfortunately, use language that evolved for informal
discourse among people engaged in every day social interaction, like
this:
<br />
<span style="color:black">
<object>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
What does the infant/child/adult/chimp/crow (etc)
perceive/understand/learn/intend (etc)?
</li>

<li>
What is he/she/it conscious of?
</li>

<li>
What does he/she/it experience/enjoy/desire?
</li>

<li>
What is he/she/it attending to?
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</object>
</span>

Instead we should understand that we are talking about a complex system
with many concurrently active parts that work together more or less
harmoniously most of the time but can sometimes come into conflict.
These parts are organised in an information-processing architecture
that maps onto brain mechanisms in complex, indirect ways that are not
well understood.
</small>
</div>
<div class="content" style="color:blue;"> <small>
So we should ask questions like this if we wish to do
deep science:
<span style="color:black">
<object>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Which parts of the architecture are involved?
</li>
<li>
What are their functions?
</li>
<li>
What kinds of
information do they acquire and use?
</li>
<li>
How do they do this?
</li>
<li>
What is the total architecture in which they function?
</li>
<li>
How is the information
represented? (It could be represented differently in different
subsystems).
</li>
<li>
What kinds of manipulations and uses of the information
occur?
</li>
<li>
What mechanisms make those processes possible?
</li>
<li>
How are the internal and external behaviours
selected/controlled/modulated/coordinated?
</li>
<li>
How many different virtual
machine levels are involved and how are they related (e.g. physical,
chemical, neural, subsymbolic, symbolic, cognitive,...)?
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</object>
</span>
<span style="color:blue">

<h1>CONJECTURE</h1>
<small>
<object>
Alongside the innate physical sucking
reflex for obtaining milk to be
digested, decomposed and used all over the body for growth, repair, and
energy, there is a genetically determined information-sucking reflex,
which seeks out, sucks in, and decomposes information, which is later
recombined in many ways, growing the information-processing architecture
and many diverse recombinable competences. Our educational system and
other factors (e.g.
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/pc-and-religion.html">mind-binding cultures</a>)
often interfere with this process, unfortunately.
<br/>

A big mistake made by governments and educational theorists is to
assume that there's a right order in which to grow the architecture,
etc. A system building a complex structure may have to assemble
different substructures in a sequence that is opportunistic and
idiosyncratic. Educational systems that do not allow for this can do
a lot of damage through excessive regimentation, e.g. based on use
of 'targets'.

<h2>SOME PRELIMINARIES AND PERMISSIONS</h2>
<object> <hr/> </object>
<b>
PERMISSION
</b>
<br/>
Anyone in the universe has my permission to use freely any information
about me on this web site or any web site created by me (subject to
obvious restrictions regarding identity theft and use of information for
criminal purposes). There are some universities in the UK that have
apparently been advised by lawyers (who make their living by trying to
prevent themselves from being sued for giving less than totally
pessimistic advice?) that if they don't get written permission to do
what everyone around the world is already doing freely they may get into
legal difficulties. So we all end up wasting yet more time asking and
giving permission, on <i>paper</i> even in the 21st century, whilst
universities elsewhere in the world just get on with the job instead.
Because administrators in UK Universities do not understand risk
management there is now a huge amount of waste caused by giving undue
weight to over-cautions recommendations of people who do not understand
requirements for doing excellent teaching and research, but do know how
to read legal documents in the most pessimistic possible way.
<br/>
Is anyone costing all the waste of tax-payers' money that results
from all these pessimistic legalistic restrictive practices?
<br/>
There has been public criticism of the waste caused by risk-averse
<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/search/search-results.htm?q=risk%20averse%20schools#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=risk%20averse%20schools&gsc.page=1">schools</a>,
but for some reason nobody has criticised universities for making similar
same mistakes, slavishly following advice from auditors who are not interested
in teaching or research.

Long ago I wrote a paper on Free Will, which I thought said

and objections have provoked me to write about

freewill</a> (two of them incoherent and the other two compatible with
determinism).

At a time when far more knowledge than ever before needs to be
acquired before anyone can either contribute to <i>extending</i>
knowledge or effectively <i>deploying</i> knowledge, our previous
government (Labour) tried (a) to reduce the length of many
university degree courses to two years and (b) to increase the
proportion of people attending university courses to 50%, at a time
when university courses need to be more intellectually challenging
than ever before in the history of mankind.
<p>
Instead of this madness we need a joined up education policy taking
account both of the diversity of employment opportunities in our
world and the diversity of human talents, providing multiple
post-school educational trajectories along with well-designed
slipways for people who start on a track that is not suited to
their capabilities and interests.

Why do UK government ministers,
most recently the
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8217172.stm">ex Armed
Forces Minister Bill Rammell</a> (and often the ex Prime Minister,
Gordon Brown) respond to criticisms of their policies, whether in
education, health or military matters, by boasting about how much
money they have spent in the last N years? Do they really not have
any understanding of the differences between the role of money and
the role of deep analysis of problems combined with <a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/opensource-and-public-funds.html">careful research and experiment</a> to find good solutions? (Merely
trying to find out what voters want does not provide information
about how to achieve what they want.) Insofar as many of those
ministers have university degrees, I suppose that is just another
manifestation of the inadequacies of the educational policies of
previous governments, alongside the inadequacies of the processes of
selection of ministers?

Letter to Lynne Jones MP about Government proposals for top-up fees

<small>
My local MP (now retired)
<a href="http://www.lynnejones.org.uk">Lynne Jones</a>
(who has close links with the University of Birmingham, including a
BSc in Biochemistry and a PhD) has consistently opposed the Government
proposal to allow universities to charge top-up fees, as well as
opposing other misguided policies and the war on Iraq.
<br/>
In January 2004 I wrote a letter expressing support for her objections
to top-up fees, arguing that the proposal is a botched stealth tax to
help fund some universities and not others, and should instead be
replaced by a coherent comprehensive policy on higher education. The
letter is available, in PDF format, here

CURRENT APPOINTMENT:
</h2>
<strong>
I was Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, but am
now formally retired, though still doing full time research while
tolerated by my School.
</strong>
<p>
In accordance with UK academic practice my job ended in September
2002, i.e. at the end of the academic year in which
I turned 65. However I was re-employed on a temporary
nominal contract which ended in September 2005, while I
continued to work full time mainly as a researcher,
helping with some management and a little teaching.
</p>

<p>
I also look after the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">Free
Poplog system</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/packages/simagent.html">some other software tools</a>
used
for teaching and research in AI.
</p>
<p>
For several years (2004-2008) most of my energy was taken up by
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/">The EC-funded CoSy project</a>
</p>

<p>
My original appointment here in 1991
was primarily a research appointment, though I  helped
with teaching related to the development of new undergraduate and
postgraduate degrees in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science,
including helping to plan the new undergraduate degrees combining AI
with Psychology, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Arts subjects.
</p>
<p>
I formally retired as an employee of the university in September 2005,
but continue to do research almost full time, helping my department with
occasional undergraduate lectures and some admin.

RESEARCH INTERESTS
</h2>
An overview of some of my main research interests can be found
in <a href="my-doings.html">my list of 'doings' over the years</a>
and <a href="research.html">here.</a>
<p></p>
My work includes cross-disciplinary research on the analysis of evolvable
virtual-machine information-processing architectures for human-like
minds (avoiding the objections to most varieties of "functionalism").
In particular I try to show that many of our ordinary mental concepts,
e.g. "consciousness", "emotion", "belief", "desire", "intention",
"intelligence", and other cognitive and affective concepts are partly
confused `cluster concepts' which can be clarified and refined (not
eliminated) if we think of them as implicitly referring to an
architecture which supports a variety of types of states and processes.
<p></p>
Getting clear about ways of extending and improving the concepts, and
avoiding endless disputes at cross purposes, requires investigating
architectures capable of explaining many kinds of normal adult human
capabilities and comparing them with other architectures, e.g. for
new-born infants, many kinds of animals, and many possible kinds of
robots and software agents. This leads to an analysis of
neighbourhoods in `design space' and `niche space' and ways in which
the evolution of human minds (and other animal minds) can be analysed in
terms of interacting trajectories in these two spaces.
<p></p>
In particular there are many more detailed ideas, some of which are
being developed within the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/">CoSy
Project</a>.
<p></p>
Papers expounding these ideas are also being produced within the
<a href="#cogaffdir"> Cognition and Affect Project</a>. Our software
tools supporting our research and teaching are mentioned in the next
section.

TYPES OF RESEARCH IN COMPUTING SCIENCE AND AI
</h2>
Following on from discussions at a
<a href="http://www.cphc.ac.uk/">CPHC</a>
conference in Manchester in 2001 on whether
there should be a UK strategy for research in CS and related disciplines
I wrote a draft paper outlining five different types of research
goals requiring different (but overlapping) evaluation criteria. It is
in this file, including comments and modifications from others:

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?

<p>
In June 1998 I was involved in a conference for careers advisers in UK
schools, talking about what AI is. The notes I prepared for attendees
are available at:

This includes an attempt to explain what Artificial Intelligence is
(both its scientific and its engineering aspects) and also a list of
UK universities at which I believe it is possible to obtain a degree in
AI or Cognitive Science. It will be updated from time to time.
</p><p>
I was on a panel set up by the Quality Assurance Agency for UK
Universities, to produce a "benchmarking" document to guide assessors of
