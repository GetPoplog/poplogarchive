<P>
This tutorial, presented by tutors with deep knowledge and experience
both in philosophy and in AI, will introduce a range of philosophical
questions relevant to the goals and methodology of AI as science and AI
as engineering, including the contribution of AI to the study of mind,
and some unresolved questions about the nature of computational systems
and how they relate to physical systems.
<P>
The mode of presentation will be a mixture of lectures and interactive
discussions.
<P>
The questions to be discussed include a selection from the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
    What is computation? How does computation extend our ontology?
<LI>
    What are virtual machines and how are they related to physical
        machines?
<LI>
    What is a virtual machine architecture?
<LI>
    Can the relations between virtual and physical machines as
        understood by computer scientists and software engineers
        shed light on philosophical questions about the relations
        between minds and brains?
<LI>
    What sorts of virtual machines can biological evolution produce?
<LI>
    What sorts of architectures can support our concepts of mentality?
<LI>
    Under what conditions might it be reasonable to describe a machine
        as conscious, or as having emotions?
<LI>
    What are representations, and how many varieties are there?
<LI>
    What sorts of ontologies are required by different organisms
        or machines?
</UL>
<P>
The tutorial can be viewed as a sequel to the Philosophical Encounter
Session at IJCAI-95, organised by Aaron Sloman and presented jointly
with Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy.

(B) SLIDES PRESENTED AT THE TUTORIAL
</B></H2>
A draft version of the tutorial slides was provided as a
printed booklet to people attending the tutorial, and may also be
on sale from AAAI  (www.aaai.org) if there are spare copies.
<P>
The slides were prepared in a hurry to meet the printing deadline, and
were re-organised and improved for the final presentation.
We prepared far more slides than there was time to go through
at the tutorial. So a subset was chosen for presentation on the day.
The slides may be downloaded from here (pointers below).

Slides 23 to 65:

Introduction to ideas about supervenience, how
the philosophers' notion of supervenience is related to the engineer's
concept of implementation, varieties of concepts of functionalism, and
the ubiquity of virtual machines in our ontology.

Architecture-based cluster concepts.
Introduction to the notion that most of our mental
concepts are cluster concepts. This explains many arguments at cross
purposes. They are also implicitly architecture-based concepts. These
are virtual machine architectures. By deepening our architectural ideas
we can refine, clarify and extend our concepts of mentality, and better
understand the variety of kinds of mentality, natural and artificial.
The CogAff schema provides a framework for describing a wide variety of
proposed architectures for natural and artificial systems, including our
H-Cogaff architecture which appears to be capable of integrating and
explaining a wide range of mental phenomena, e.g. perception, reasoning,
emotions (several varieties), many disorders of mind, and sensory and
other types of qualia.
<LI>

Slides 106 to 136:
</B>
Discussion of the objection that virtual machine
events cannot have causal powers if the virtual machine is fully
implemented in physics. The reply requires a satisfactory analysis of
the concept of "cause" -- one of the hardest unsolved problems in
philosophy. A partial analysis is sketched, and shown to accommodate
parallel causation in hierarchies of virtual machines.

(C) A DETAILED OUTLINE OF THE TUTORIAL (as in the proposal to the
conference committee)
</B></H2>
<P>
The tutorial will introduce some old philosophical concepts along with
the problems they generate, and attempt to show how these problems take
on a new form in the light of developments in Computer Science, Software
Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience.
<P>
The tutorial will begin with a brief overview of some of central
problems in:
<P>
o Metaphysics
    (the study of what kinds of things exist (ontology), including
    questions about the nature of causation and the relations
    between mind and matter)
<P>
o Epistemology
    (the study of what kinds of things can be known)
<P>
o Philosophy of mind
    (a more detailed study of what minds are and how are they related
    to brains, or computers)
<P>
o Philosophy of computing
<P>
An introduction to ontology will include the idea of "comparative
descriptive ontology": the study of different sorts of ontologies to be
found in different sorts of organisms, different sorts of humans (e.g.
children, adults, humans from different cultures) and ontologies that
might be useful for various kinds of machines.
<P>
The idea of an architecture-based ontology will be presented, as
an extension of the method of conceptual analysis in philosophy.
<P>
This will be illustrated by outlining some ways in which developments in
computing have led to developments in our own ontology, in particular
the recent extension of our scientific ontology to include information
processing machines, including virtual information processing machines,
on the basis of which our ontology has been extended with a host of new
concepts referring to objects, events and processes that can occur in
such machines (e.g. procedures, closures, memory management, garbage
collection, circular lists, sub-symbolic computation, etc.)
<P>
There are a number of deep problems about the nature of such machines,
what sorts of existence they have, whether they can have causal powers,
and how they are related to the underlying physical machines.
<P>
E.g. when we talk about a lisp virtual machine running in a computer are
we really talking in an obscure way about *physical* processes occurring
in the electronic devices in the machine, or are there also non-physical
entities, events and processes involving such things as numbers,
strings, lists, trees, graphs, procedures, procedure activations, etc.?
<P>
Can events in these virtual machines have effects, including physical
effects, and if so is that consistent with the assumption that physical
reality is a causally closed system? This will have to be discussed in
the light of hard philosophical problems about the nature of causation,
and how causation is related to counterfactual conditionals.
<P>
The intuitive notions of "implementation", or "realisation", employed by
software engineers and computer scientists will be analysed and compared
with the notion of "supervenience" which is used by philosophers to
discuss the relationship between mental and physical phenomena.
<P>
This in turn will lead to questions about whether minds might be
implemented in computers, in the context of the more general question:
What sorts of minds can be implemented in what sorts of physical
machines?
<P>
Detailed investigations of such questions will include analysis of a
range of mental concepts including "experience", "feeling",
"perceiving", "motivation", "emotion", "mood". We shall try to show how
relating these old concepts to more refined new concepts derived from
the capabilities of different sorts of virtual machine architectures,
can provide a basis for answering questions such as: which sorts of
emotions are possible in which sorts of machines? For example we can
distinguish a range of increasingly sophisticated types of emotions
(primary, secondary, tertiary, ...) and show how they presuppose
increasingly complex information processing architectures.
<P>
More detailed discussions will lead on to analysis of familiar AI
questions such as what representations are, how many varieties there
are, which sorts of architectures can support them, etc.
<P>

If there is time, all this will be related to questions about the
evolution of mind and whether minds of the sorts discussed in the
tutorial could be produced by biological evolution.
<P>

The presentation will be highly interactive, with active encouragement
of audience participation.
<P>

It is not expected that in the time available full coverage of all these
topics will be achieved. However it is hoped that participants will
acquire some understanding of problems like these and how to discuss
them, e.g. with philosophers critical of AI.
<P>

<H2><B>
(D) POTENTIAL TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE TUTORIAL,
    INCLUDING PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE. INDICATE WHICH OF THE ABOVE
    OBJECTIVES ARE BEST SERVED BY THE PROPOSED TUTORIAL.
</B></H2>
<P>

The potential target audience:

<UL>
<LI> researchers in AI who are interested in philosophical questions,
including teachers who would like to be able to present philosophical
questions about AI in their course material.

<LI> AI graduate students who would like to learn about philosophy but do
not have opportunities as part of their normal studies, e.g. because
there are no philosophers in their department

<LI> Philosophers who are interested in AI and would like to learn more
about how AI can be defended against some of the attacks on AI made
by philosophers who are ill-informed about AI, computer science and
software engineering.
</UL>
<P>
The tutorial will relate to the following objectives listed in the
call for tutorials
<UL>
  <LI> Introduce novices to major topics of Artificial Intelligence:
    <BR>
        Philosophical questions have always loomed large in AI,
        ever since Turing published his 1950 paper.

  <LI> Motivate and explain an AI topic of emerging importance:
    <BR>
        This tutorial may help to provide a context for the
        steadily increasing amount of work on ontology in AI,
        as well as work on specific topics concerning mental states
        and processes, such motivation and emotions.

  <LI> Present a novel synthesis combining distinct lines of AI work:
    <BR>
        We hope that our presentation will show how developments
        in AI, computer science and philosophy can be synthesised
        in a new way, centred round the key notion of a virtual
        information processing architecture.
</UL>

<H2><B>
(D) A description of why the tutorial topic would be of interest to a
  substantial part of the IJCAI audience.
</B></H2>

    This is essentially answered by the preceding sections. It is
    perhaps relevant that the "Philosophical encounter" at IJCAI-95
    which was allocated a double length session attracted a very
    large audience with lively contributions from the floor.

CV FOR AARON SLOMAN
</B></H3>
BSc Mathematics and Physics 1st class, Cape Town, 1956,
DPhil in philosophy, Oxford 1962
<P>

Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College Oxford 1957-1960, Senior Scholar at St
Antony's College 1960-62. GEC Professorial Fellow 1984-6. Elected Fellow
of the American Association for AI in 1991. Elected honorary life Fellow
of AISB in 1997. Elected Fellow of ECCAI in 1999. Regularly invited as
keynote speaker at seminars, international conferences and workshops.

<P>
Taught philosophy at Hull then Sussex University for several years, but
decided around 1970 that AI provided the best context for studying many
old philosophical problems. Did battle with McCarthy and Hayes at IJCAI
in 1971 (paper on non-logical representations reprinted in AI Journal
1971). After a year learning about AI in Edinburgh in 1972-3 as SRC
senior visiting fellow returned to Sussex and later helped to found the
School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, and wrote an
influential book
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/crp/">``The Computer Revolution in Philosophy'' (1978).</a>
<P>

Continued working on philosophy, on the architecture of visual systems,
and tools for teaching and research in AI. Managed the development of
Poplog, a sophisticated multi-language AI development environment (sold
by ISL for several years, but now available free of charge, though
still used in commercial products, e.g. Clementine.)
<P>

After 27 years at Sussex wanted a change. In 1991 moved to the
School of Computer Science in the University of Birmingham, where he
also collaborates with members of the School of Psychology.
Still working on AI tools (e.g. the SIM_AGENT toolkit), hybrid
architectures for intelligent agents, the evolution of consciousness,
architectural support for motivation and emotions, issues concerned with
representation, mathematical thinking, vision, and related philosophical
problems in AI and computing.
