The slides used for my lecture on vision can be found here
as promised:
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/talks/#talk8
">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/talks/#talk8</a>
<BR>
They are available in several formats including postscript, PDF and
two-up PDF (two slides per page, for less wasteful printing)
<BR>
(The slides were written using Latex).
<BR>
There are more slides than I presented in the lecture.
<P>
My
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/talks/">talks</a>
website has many other slide presentations that you are welcome to use.
<P>
The Birmingham
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">Cognition and Affect</a>
website has many papers and PhD theses on it.
<P>
There is a robotics project called 'CoSy', funded by the European
Community which involves 7 Universities in different places, and which I
hope will address some of the issues mentioned in my talk.
The Birmingham website for CoSy is
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/</a>
Take a look at this partial specification of the tasks in designing the
robot called

Exercise
</B></H3>
<UL>
<LI>
Try to make a list of the the different purposes for which humans use
vision.
<LI>
Try to find out how many of those uses can now be demonstrated in
artificial vision systems, by searching the internet, reading books on
vision, etc.

Online programs, tutorials and help files on vision in Pop11
</B></H2>
There is a very useful collection of online teaching materials and image
processing utilities called 'Popvision', written in a mixture of Pop11
and C (with some Fortran) developed by
<a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/profile3041.html">David Young</a>
at Sussex University.
<P>
The popvision library is available as part of Poplog. In addition to
tutorial materials and tools on image analysis it includes some nice
tools for displaying and manipulating images in Pop11. To find out what
is in the package you first need to make it available.
<BR>
In Pop11 do

<PRE>
    uses popvision
</PRE>

Then in the editor, VED, or XVED, try these commands. There are many
example bits of code that you can run from the editor.
<PRE>
    HELP POPVISION
    TEACH RC_ARRAY
</PRE>
Other teach files available

<PRE>
    VISION1 - image representation and display
    VISION2 - introduction to convolution
    VISION3 - further convolution, Gaussian masks and edge detection
    VISION4 - the Hough transform
    VISION5 - perspective projection and stereoscopic vision
    VISION6 - visual motion
    VISION7 - active contours
</PRE>

The package also includes a matlab-like library for linear algebra.
<HR>
<H2><B>
A very useful overview of recent work on active vision

Taking notes in lectures
</B></H2>
<P>
Please remember: if you sit passively listening in lectures you will not
remember anything later: you need to be active in some way, e.g. taking
rough notes on the content of the lecture, and then later that day or
the next day, take your notes and re-write them in a more coherent form.
After that you can throw them away: the point is not to have the notes
in the end, but to engage with the notes by doing something active.
That's how you will learn -- and stretch your minds, which is presumably
what you came to University to do.
<P>
If you think I should provide any more information on this web page,
please let me know.
