HOW TO READ PAPERS AND SLIDES IN POSTSCRIPT AND PDF FORMAT

This file is now probably dispensable since almost everything I
produce is available in either plain text, html, or pdf, and
nobody should have problems reading any of these, given the
capabilities of widely availabel internet browsers (e.g.
<a href="http://en.www.mozilla.com/en/firefox/">Firefox</a>)
and PDF viewers, including Acrobat reader, xpdf, kpdf,
okular,
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/">evince,</a>
and others.

DOWNLOADABLE VIEWERS
</B></h3>
Most of my papers and slide presentations accessible through the
Cognition and Affect project directory
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/</a>
or through my talks/presentations directory
 <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/misc/talks/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/misc/talks/</a>
are available on the web in PDF format, and some of the older ones
are also in Postscript.
<P>
These are formats which are publicly specified and for which there are
freely available readers which work on many types of computers and
operating systems. (I use only Unix and Linux operating systems
running on Suns and PCs). Some governments have introduced
legislation requiring publicly funded organisations to use only public,
open formats for documents. (I believe Peru led the way, years ago.)
All governments should do the same.
<P>
<h3><B>
Unix and linux users
</B></h3>
Most unix and linux users will already have "gv" for reading postscript,
and some versions of "gv" can also display PDF. Another useful reader
for PDF (on linux/unix systems) is <B>xpdf</B> (small and fast):
<a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/</a>

<h3><B>
PDF Viewer from Adobe (for all platforms)
</B></h3>
<B>Acrobat  reader</B>
is available for reading PDF from Adobe. This link worked in 2012:
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/">http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/</a>
<br/>
If it fails, use a search engine.
<P>
This can be used on linux, a variety of unix platforms, windows, and
macs.

PC+Windows Users

For reading and printing postscript files, PC+Windows users can obtain
"ghostview" from
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/</a>

How my papers and presentation slides are produced.
</B></h3>
Many of my papers, discussion notes,
and tutorial materialas are plain text or html.
<p>
However, most of them are produced in
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/intro.html">Latex</a>. This
has faclities for producing both postscript and PDF files. In the
past I produced
postscript which I converted to PDF
using ps2pdf or distill. Nowadays I simply use
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/texslides/">pdflatex</a>
to produce papers and presentations in PDF format, and do not
produce a postscript version. Occasionally I also use
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>, e.g. to convert
html to PDF, or in some cases to produce PDF from a word file
created by a collaborator. (Now superseded by LibreOffice available from
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">http://www.libreoffice.org/</a>)
<P>
<H3><B>
TGIF
</B></H3>
The diagrams are all produced using the tgif package, a small, fast,
versatile, user-friendly and FREE package which runs under the X window
system. (Many people use xfig for this. It's a matter of personal
preference.).
<br>
Tgif can be
used for preparing diagrams, for capturing screen images to be inserted
in diagrams, and also for
preparing and presenting slide presentations with "active" regions,
and more besides. (I.e. it has much of the functionality of powerpoint.)
It can save diagrams in many formats, including "eps"
for inclusion in other documents. Tgif is freely available
for linux and unix systems from these sites:
<UL>
<LI>
<a href="http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/">http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/</a>
<LI>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/tgif/">ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/tgif/</a>
<br>(Older versions only)
</UL>
However, I am likely to start using
<a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
for diagrams in future, as that provides a much wider rang of
facilities than TGIF, and also provides much more convenient
text-formatting capabilities for annotated diagrams.
<P>
<H3><B>
LaTeX
</B></H3>
My slides and papers are all composed in a plain text editor (I use Ved,
the programmable editor provided in
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html">Poplog,</a>
but any editor can be used) using Latex formatting commands. For my
slides I use home-grown macros. The output of latex can be displayed
on unix and linux systems using xdvi (though older versions of xdvi
do not handle colours). I use dvips to transform the dvi format to
postscript, which is suitable both for displaying and for printing.
The pdflatex command goes straight to pdf, without producing dvi
files.
<P>
Most of the papers and older presentations are in A4 Portrait format
(long edge vertical). Since about May 2001, have prepared slide
presentations in the landscape format, which is more suited to fill
a typical computer screen which is wider than it is tall. These need
to be viewed in "Landscape" or "Seascape" mode (rotated 90 degrees
to the left). Your browser should either automatically detect the
orientation and show it correctly, or provide a mechanism for
rotating 90 degrees left or right. If you are using "gv" it may show
the slides in landscape format but upside down. In that case select
"seascape". On some displays you may have problems with slides that
use colour, if you have anti-aliasing turned on in "gv". You can
solve this by turning it off, though the text will then look
slightly poorer.
<P>
If anyone would like a copy of my latex style file used to produce
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/misc/talks/">the slide
presentations</a>, just
ask. (Email: A.Sloman AT cs.bham.ac.uk).
<P>
28 Jan 2006: I found a web page commenting on the quirky style of a
presentation I gave in 2002, so I wrote a little response
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/talks/quirky.html">here,
</a> explaining why I do what I do and why I don't like flashy gimmicky
presentations.
