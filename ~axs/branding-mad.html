Subject: Re-branding gone mad
<P>
I've now handed in a perfectly good identity card and received
another one which as far as I am concerned has exactly the same
functionality, though there are some minor changes to the
appearance which are of no consequence since I never show the
card to anything but a card-reader slot.
<P>
Even if I had to show it to a human, nothing of significance that is
relevant to its function as an identity card has changed.
<P>
Does anyone know how much it has cost to replace all these cards,
or why anyone even thought it necessary?
<P>
Should we report this waste of tax-payers money to government ministers
and the press?
<P>
After all, the money comes out of income given to the university to do
teaching and research.

<a href="branding.html">More on the background to this.</a>
and also
<a href="http://www.general.bham.ac.uk/brand/">
the spurious justifications given for the exercise by
people responsible for it
</a>
-- who seem to understand little about what
a university is, however well-meaning and hard-working they may be.
<P>
This is what comes of academics delegating far too much responsbility to
adminstrators and other non-academic decision-makers who don't have to
work at the coal-face of extending and promulgating knowledge, and have
little or no experience of the diversity of functions,
responsibilities and commitments of academics -- even if some of them
have university degrees.

<P>
Comment by one respondent:
<PRE>
The change, I have noticed, is that BU is now a BIG university in the
new card, not a SMALL university as in the old one.
