<b>Key Ideas</b>
<p>
Many researchers propose a theory of THE right architecture for a system with some kind of
intelligence (e.g. human intelligence).
<p>
Although this may be an appropriate way to address a specific technical problem, it is
seriously misguided, if done as a contribution to our scientific or philosophical
understanding, unless the specific architecture is related to a theory about THE SPACE of
POSSIBLE architectures for various kinds of intelligent system.
<p>
Such a theory would need to include a survey of the possible types of component, the
different ways they can be combined, the different functions that might be present, the
different types of information that might be acquired and used, the different ways such
information could be represented and processed, the different ways the architecture could
come into existence (e.g. built fully formed, or self-assembling), and how various changes
in the design affect changes in functionality.
<p>
Such a theory also needs to be related to a study of possible sets of requirements for
architectures (and for their components). If we don't consider architectures in relation
to what they are used for or needed for (in particular types of context) then we have no
way of explaining why they should have the features they have or what the trade-offs
between alternative design options are.
<p>
<b>NB</b>
<br/>
These investigations should not be restricted to <i>physical</i> architectures.
Since the mid-twentieth century human engineers have increasingly found virtual machine
architectures, in which multiple virtual machine components interact with one another and
with physical components. It seems that biological evolution "discovered" the need for
virtual machinery, especially self-modifying and self-monitoring virtual machinery, long
before human engineers did. This and other "discoveries" by natural
selection, and its products, are investigated in the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/meta-morphogenesis.html">Meta-Morphogenesis
project</a>.
<p>
<b>Topics investigated include:</b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
The space of possible <b>designs</b> for architectures (design space):
(what sorts of design options are available at various stages in the evolution of more
complex designs and in various environments?).
<p>
<li>
The space of possible sets of <b>requirements</b> for architectures (niche space, since a niche
is a set of requirements) is distinct from, but related to the space of possible
designs.
<p>
<center>
<img alt="XX" border="1" width="400" src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/map.jpg"/>
<br>
Arrows indicate that instances of possible designs may be
<br>
suited to instances of sets of requirements (niches).
</center>
<p>
<li>
The possible evolutionary, developmental, learning, social, cultural and
ecological
<b>trajectories</b> through these spaces, and the feedback-control loops that
they form. (New requirements can lead to new designs to meet those requirements,
which can produce new requirements or opportunities for that species, or new
requirements and opportunities for other species -- e.g. predators, or prey.)
<p>
<li>
How various architectures, mechanisms, and forms of representation meet, or fail
to meet, or partially meet, the various sets of requirements against which they
can be evaluated. This includes investigating tradeoffs among the alternatives.
<p>
<li>
The requirements that led to different sorts of <b>virtual</b> machinery and the various designs
for such virtual machinery, including evolution of "protocols" for interactions of various
sorts between components, between hardware systems, between virtual machine sub-systems,
... the origins of internally self-directed conscious states and the discovery
of qualia, and other mental phenomena supported by virtual machinery.
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/vm-func.html">Virtual-machine functionalism.</a>

</ul>
<p>
Ignoring the <b>variety</b> in these spaces, and instead proposing and studying
just ONE architecture (e.g. for an emotional machine) is like doing physics by
finding out how things work around the leaning tower of Pisa, and ignoring all
other physical environments; or like trying to do biology by studying just one
species; or like trying to study chemistry by proposing one complex molecule for
investigation.
<p>
That's why, unlike other research groups, most of which propose an architecture,
argue for its engineering advantages or its evidential support, then build a
tool to build models using that architecture, we have tried, instead, to build
tools to explore alternative architectures so that we can search the space of
designs, including trying to find out which types evolved and why, instead of
simply promoting <b>one</b> design. Our
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/packages/simagent.html">
SimAgent  toolkit</a>
(sometimes called "sim_agent") was designed to support exploration of that space, unlike
toolkits that are committed to a particular type of architecture. Some videos of
toy demos mostly produced in the 1990s can be found
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/fig/simagent">here.</a>

<h3><b>
Start of the CogAff (Cognition and Affect) Project
<br/>
Birmingham, 1991.
</b></h3>

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
The project was begun by
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs">Aaron Sloman</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_W._Humphreys">Glyn Humphreys</a>
(then head of Psychology in Birmingham)
in 1991, who later moved to Oxford. (He died
suddenly in 2016 and is remembered
<a href="http://88.202.227.92/~glyn/">here</a>.)
<p>
When the work began in 1991 it was a continuation of work begun in the 1960s in
the School of Social Sciences at The University of Sussex, and later continued
in the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences (COGS). (That, in turn, was a
continuation of my <a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/sloman-1962/">1962
Oxford DPhil Thesis</a> attempting to defend Kant's philosophy of mathematics.)
<p>
Some of the earliest work was reported in this 1978 book (now out of print, but
available online):
<br>
<a href="crp">The Computer Revolution in Philosophy: Philosophy, science and
models of mind</a>
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The book was originally published in 1978. Thanks to the efforts of Manuela
Viezzer and Sammy Snow it was scanned in 2001 and the chapters were made
available in html format, with some notes added (since 2002). Later PDF versions
of the chapters were derived from the html and copies of the whole book in PDF
format made freely available here, and various other places, including
<a href="http://www.theassc.org/content/the_computer_revolution_in_philosophy_philosophy_science_and_models_of_mind">the
ASSC repository</a> -- since anyone could
freely copy it. In 2015, a new revised edition was produced, with all the
chapters in a single internally cross-referenced HTML file, from which a PDF
version was derived:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/crp.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/crp.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/crp.pdf">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/crp.pdf</a>
<br>
The latest version is also freely available, with a "Creative Commons" licence.
<p>
In addition, an "Afterthoughts" document was begun in August 2015, and will
continue to grow, freely available here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/crp-afterthoughts.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/crp-afterthoughts.html</a>
<br>
(also in PDF).
<p>
<a href="crp/#chap7">Chapter
7</a> on "Intuition and analogical reasoning", including reasoning with diagrams,
and <a href="crp/#chap8">Chapter 8</a> "On Learning about Numbers" were
specially closely related to the 1962 DPhil work on the nature of mathematical
knowledge.
</div>
After AS moved to Birmingham, the work was partly funded by a grant to Sloman
and Humphreys, from the UK Joint Council Initiative (JCI), which paid for a
workstation and a studentship. An additional studentship was funded by the
Renaissance Trust
<a href="http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/TEXTS/gerry_eulogy.pdf">(Gerry Martin).</a>
<p>
The first PhD thesis completed in the project was by <a href="https://cogzest.com">Luc Beaudoin</a>
(funded by major
scholarships from: Quebec's FCAR, The Association of Commonwealth Universities (UK), and
the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada). The
this is online <a href="phd-theses.html">here</a>, along with others. Among
other things, it offered
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/81-95.html#16"> a new, unusually detailed analysis</a>
of aspects of motives that can change over time, and introduced the important
distinction between <i>deliberative</i> mechanisms (which can represent,
explore, hypothesise, plan and select possible situations, processes and future
actions) and <i>meta-management</i> mechanisms which can can monitor, and to
some extent control internal processes (including deliberative processes). Some
of the ideas are explained in more detail in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/fully-deliberative.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/fully-deliberative.html</a>
<p>
Later PhD students who built on and extended the ideas are listed
<a href="phd-theses.html">here (with online theses)</a>. In particular a
paper summarising some of the key ideas in the context of long term grief,
including phenomena that refute many theories of emotions/affect was published
(by invitation) in the journal
<i>Philosophy Psychiatry and Psychology</i> in 1996
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/96-99.html#2">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/96-99.html#2</a>.
<p>
Similar work elsewhere on architectures for intelligent agents uses labels such
as "reflective", "metacognitive", "executive functions", and "self-regulation",
though often with different features emphasised. There is still no generally
agreed ontology for describing architectures and their functions, unfortunately
-- leading to much reinvention of wheels, often poorly designed wheels.
(The BICA society <a href="#recent">(mentioned below)</a>
is an attempt to remedy this.)
<p>
Later extensions arose from funding by DERA which enabled <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~bsl/">Brian Logan</a> to work here for
several years, followed by a project funded by <a href="http://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/">The Leverhulme Trust</a> on <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/lev">
Evolvable virtual information processing architectures for human-like minds, </a>
originally set up with Brian Logan, which then paid for Matthias Scheutz to work here for
13 months (2000-2001), followed  by Ron Chrisley (2001-2003).
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/03.html#200307">
A progress report on the CogAff project was written in 2003
(separate document).</a>
<p>
From 2004 related work was funded by the EU, in two projects on
cognitive robotics
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/">CoSy</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogx">CogX</a>.
<p>
For a while some of the work was done as part of the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/robotics/">Intelligent Robotics</a>
research laboratory (led by <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw">Jeremy Wyatt</a>) at Birmingham.
However, the externally funded projects, partly under pressure from
collaborators had to focus on more specific targets and techniques, so the more
theoretical work reported here, and in the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/meta-morphogenesis.html">Meta-Morphogenesis project</a>
spawned around 2012, continued mostly independently, though with potential
implications for future ambitious robotic projects.

<b>Links with Biology</b>
<br>
In 2004,
<a href="http://jackiechappell.com/">Jackie Chappell</a>
arrived in the School of Biosciences (having previously worked in Oxford, in
the Behavioural Ecology
department led by Prof Alex Kacelnik). Our ways of thinking about
intelligence in animals had significant overlap so we
worked together on extending biologists' ideas about
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/05.html#200502"> "Altricial" and

CogAff is really a loose, informal, collection of sub-projects, most of them unfunded at any time,
including research on architectures, forms of representation and mechanisms occurring in
humans, other animals, and human-like machines.
<p>
Some additional topics covered can be found in <a href="cogaff.html">this document</a> compiled in 2009
and this list of
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/AREADME.html">online discussion papers</a>
(frequently extended).
<p>
Analysing such architectures, and the mental states and processes they can support, allows
us to investigate, for instance, whether consciousness or the ability to have emotional
states is an accident of animal evolution or a direct evolutionary consequence of
biological requirements or a side-effect of things meeting other requirements and
constraints.
<p>
One of the outcomes of this research was development of the CogAff schema
introduced above and <a href="misc/cogaff-cosy-poster.pdf">(explained briefly in
this poster)</a>. The schema (especially when elaborated beyond those simple
diagrammatic specifications) is a  high level abstraction that can be
instantiated in many different special case architectures. This provides a way
of characterising a wide range of types of possible architecture in natural and
artificial systems (in contrast with most researchers on cognitive architectures
who promote a particular architecture).
<p>
A special case (or subclass) of CogAff is the H-CogAff (Human-Cogaff) architecture, described
<a href="#hcogaff">below</a>, which is still currently too difficult to implement, though various subsets have been
implemented by researchers here and elsewhere. Some "toy" versions are used in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/simagent">demonstration videos</a>
of student programs running.
<p>
The collaboration with Jackie Chappell, and our presentation at IJCAI 2005,
led to an invited paper for a new
interdisciplinary journal in 2007
"Natural and artificial meta-configured altricial information-processing
systems"
<i>International Journal of Unconventional Computing</i>
available
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/07.html#717">here.</a>
Some of our key ideas, extending Waddington's ideas about the "Epigenetic
Landscape", are summarised (perhaps too obscurely) in this diagram (extending
the version in the paper):

</center>
<p>
One of the implications of those ideas is that the information processing
architecture of an organism can change during development in ways that depend on
the influence of the environment -- insofar as the environment can influence how
the genome is expressed, as indicated roughly in the above diagram. This is one
of the themes of the Meta-Morphogenesis project mentioned several times in this
document. For more detail see

<b>Requirements for architectural theories: The CogAff
(generative Schema)</b>
<ul>
<li>
Natural architectures evolved to fit many different biological niches. We need, but don't
yet have, an agreed conceptual framework for describing both architectures and
requirements/niches.
<p>
<li>
We can move towards an agreed ontology for architectural designs by making some high
level distinctions, e.g. between
<p>
<div style="margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
  1.a sensory/perceptual processes constantly changing to
  represent the environment (including internal states)
<p>
  2.a motor/action/effector processes constantly changing
  the environment and perhaps some internal states
<p>
  3.a central, more slowly changing, processes
<p>

<div style="margin-left:-15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
or between
</div>
<p>

  1.b Evolutionarily very old reactive processes, constantly
  driven by what is sensed internally and externally
<p>
  2.b Newer deliberative processes able to represent what does
  not exist but might, e.g. future actions, unseen situations,
  past causes.
<p>
  3.b Specialised meta-management/reflective processes capable
  of describing information-processes states and processes in
  oneself and also in others.
  Debates about which came first, self understanding or other understanding
  are futile: they almost certainly grew together in fits and starts. Some
further details concerning these distinctions are available here:

By superimposing the above two classifications we get the following suggestive,
but in some ways misleading, 3x3 grid of possible types of architectural
component, misleading because not all the required mechanisms will fit into
just one of the boxes.

The CogAff schema shown above summarises this space of possible types of architectural

-- The first three divisions above (1.a--3.a) correspond to the vertical divisions in the

<p>
-- The second three divisions above (1.b--3.b) correspond to the horizontal divisions in

<p>
This is an over-simplification (a) because each layer should be more finely
divided into components performing different functions, (b) because the columns
and layers should overlap more (as in the diagram below), and (c) because there
are mechanisms that straddle, or link components in, the various boxes in the
diagram, including the "alarm" mechanisms that can play a role in emotions and
other affective states. A revised (but still inadequate) version of the diagram

<b>Connections with Marvin Minsky's ideas</b>

I met Marvin Minsky briefly during a conference at MIT in 1975, but more
detailed interaction began later via online discussions using Usenet/NetNews.
I had previously met John McCarthy at IJCAI 1971, where I criticised his
important 1969 paper with Pat Hayes. Usenet discussions of consciousness,
emotions and other topics often involved both McCarthy and Minsky. Both of them
accepted my invitation to take part in a special panel on philosophy and AI at
IJCAI 1995, as shown in this picture

His 2006 book <i>The Emotion Machine</i> explicitly refers to some of our
architectural ideas, but he preferred to separate out the architectural scheme
into more layers, e.g. dividing our reactive layer into reflexes and other
reactions.

<b>NB
A Schema for architectures is not an architecture.</b>
<p>
It is more like a grammar. Instances of the schema are like sentences in the grammar.
However the CogAff schema is a grammar whose 'sentences' are not strings but quite
complex networks of concurrently active mechanisms with different functions, as discussed
in this paper on

<b>A special subset of the CogAff schema: Architectures with Alarms</b>
<p>
<b>Fig Alarms</b>

<p>
<a name="alarms"></a>
<b>Alarm mechanisms, states and processes (added 6 Nov 2013)</b>
<br/>
Many organisms seem to have, and many robots and other intelligent machines will need, an
"alarm" mechanism, which receives input from many of the internal and external sensors and
is capable of recognising patterns that require very rapid global reorganisation of
ongoing processes, for example switching into states like fleeing, attacking, freezing, or
attending closely to what may or may not be a sign of serious danger or some opportunity.
<p> This kind of mechanism seems to be very old in animal evolution and can be observed in
a woodlouse, for example, when it reacts to being touched by rolling itself up in a ball,
or a fly which reacts to the rapid approach of a fly-swat by stopping whatever it is doing
(e.g. feeding) and switching to an escape action.
<p>
The kinds of effects of alarm mechanisms will obviously depend on various factors
such as
<ul>
<li>
Where their inputs come from (e.g. direct from low-level perceptual subsystems, or
indirectly via more sophisticated processing layers);
<li>
Where the outputs go (e.g. direct to low level motor control subsystems or to some
other part of the architecture, e.g. awakening some memory, or re-activating a
dormant motive, or grabbing control of many different resources);
<li>
How long the 'alarmed' states last -- some are very short (e.g. being started) others
may last a long time as in extended anxiety or grief, possibly enduring in parallel
with other, unrelated, short term alarms, e.g. being startled by a noise;
<li>
Whether the outputs from the alarm system actually interfere with other subsystems
or merely have a tendency to interfere, but fail to have an effect (we use the label
"perturbance" to include these dispositions to perturb or disturb, which may be real
but ineffective, or partially effective, etc.
<li>
Many theories of emotion (especially theories that over-emphasise bodily states, or
action tendencies, like the James-Lange theory and its many derivatives) imply or
state that an individual can be in only one emotional state at a time, whereas this
architecture allows several different sorts of perturbance to coexist, including
different sorts. It is also possible for an enduring state to be temporarily dormant,
as in grief or jealousy.
<li>
We do not claim that humans are born with such an architecture fully developed: it
obviously grows over time. (A newborn human infant is incapable of feeling despair at
the long term effects of human population growth.) That implies that at different
stages of development different affective states are possible, including different
emotions.
<li>
Since emotional states can very in their complexity, in the architectural resources,
conceptual apparatus and potential interactions with other states and processes, no
theory of emotions that places them in a space of some fixed set of dimensions can be
correct. Rather we need something like <b>grammar</b> for types of emotion and for
types of emotional process extended in time. See <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/81-95.html#emot-gram">Sloman(1982)</a>
<br/>
See also: Aaron Sloman,
Review of <b>Affective Computing </b> by Rosalind W. Picard, 1997,
in <b>The AI Magazine,</b> 20, 1, 1999, pp. 127--133,
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/Sloman.picard.review.pdf">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/Sloman.picard.review.pdf</a>
That and other CogAff papers in the 1990s proposed that the then popular distinction
between "primary" and "secondary" emotions based on different criteria used by
different authors should be expanded to include at least the following:
<ul>
<li>
Primary emotions: involving only mechanisms at the reactive level.
<li>
Secondary emotions: involving some mechanisms at the deliberative level (in addition
to reactive mechanisms).
<li>
Tertiary emotions: involving some mechanisms at the meta-management level, making use
of meta-semantic concepts possibly referring to one's own mental states and
processes, or those of others. (Recently other researchers have been using the
primary/secondary/tertiary labels in different ways, not usually architecture-based.)
<li>
In addition there are many affective states and processes that are not emotions,
including desires, preferences, intentions, attitudes, ambitions, moods,..., and
probably many more components of the architecture in different species.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
<br/>
It can be difficult to get 'professional' emotion researchers to take
such theories seriously, since they are educated to use observation, measurements,
questionnaires, statistical packages, but not to think about how to design, test and
debug complex <b>working</b> information-processing systems, which is what humans and
other animals are. See
Margaret A. Boden,
<b>Mind As Machine: A history of Cognitive Science (Vols 1--2)</b>
Oxford University Press, 2006,
<p>
A symptom of that educational inadequacy is attempting to find a few
"dimensions" in which features of emotions can be classified and then taking the
resulting 2 or 3 (or sometimes higher) dimensional grid as providing a
principled classification of emotions.
<p>
<b>
But complex information processing systems can get into states that vary in far
more complex ways than such simple-minded tables or graphs can accommodate: as
any system designer knows.
</b>
</ul>

<h3><b>
Special cases of the CogAff schema
</b></h3>
<p>
A very crude depiction of an insect-like information processing architecture
with alarms could be something like this:
<p>
<b>Fig Insect</b>
<img alt="Insect Alarms?" height="350" width="300"
src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/reactemot.gif"/>
<p>
An insect-like special case of the CogAff schema is purely reactive -- none of the
deliberative or meta-management functions are provided, though reactive
mechanisms may be layered, as indicated crudely in the diagram.
<p>
[Modified: 7 Dec 2012] A purely reactive system that always merely reacts to
particular stimuli could be modified to include "proto-deliberative" mechanisms
(unfortunately labelled "deliberative" by Michael Arbib at a conference in
2002). In a proto-deliberative system, reactive mechanisms can simultaneously
trigger two incompatible response-tendencies. Since in general a blend of two
incompatible responses is worse than either response, it can be useful to have
mechanisms for choosing one of them, e.g. using a comparison of strength, or
some other mechanism such as always letting escape reactions win over feeding
reactions, or using a self-organising neural net capable of achieving a variety
of potentially-stable states, then adopting one.
<p>
For more more on different intermediate
cases see this discussion of
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/fully-deliberative.html">"Fully Deliberative" systems</a>.
<p>
In such a (relatively) simple architecture, alarm mechanisms can trigger simple emotions
(e.g. in the woodlouse that rapidly curls up in a ball if touched while walking).
<p>
<a name="omega"></a>
<p>
<b>Another special subset of the CogAff schema: Omega Architectures</b>
<p>
<b>Fig Omega</b>
<img alt="Omega Architectures" height="350" width="300"
src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/gridomega.jpg"/>
<p>
Architectures of this general type where the flow of information and control can be
thought of as roughly like the Greek capital letter Omega <b>&Omega;</b> (not necessarily presented
in this sort of diagram) are often re-invented.
<p>
The assumption is that perception consists of detection of low level physical signals that
are processed at increasing levels of abstraction until the processing generates new goals
or preferences, at which point some selection mechanism (e.g. contention scheduling)
chooses the best motive or action and the then signals propagate downwards to the motor
subsystems which then produce behaviour.
<p>
This "peephole" (or "peep-hole") view of perception and action contrasts with the
"multi-window" view of both perception and action as involving concurrent processing at
different levels of abstraction, partly under the control of the environment and partly
under the control of various layers of central information processing, operating in
parallel.
<p>
So some of the more abstract perceptual or motor processing can be thought of as
both cognitive insofar as they make use of forms of representation and
ontologies shared with more central processing mechanisms, and also as
peripheral (e.g. perception or action processes) because the information
structures used are maintained in registration with perceptual input signals (or
the optic array in the case of visual input) or in registration with motor
signal arrays, and also because the processing at those more abstract levels is
bi-directionally closely coupled with the lower level perceptual or motor
signals.
<p>
These extra layers of perceptual or motor processing are fairly obviously needed
for language production or perception because it is now well understood that
linguistic expressions have structures at different levels of abstraction that
all need specialised processing. Our claim is that that is a special case of a
far more general phenomenon (as illustrated in the POPEYE program described in
<a href="crp/#chap9">Chapter 9</a> of <a href="crp">The Computer Revolution
in in Philosophy</a> 1978).

several ways, e.g. because it does not clearly distinguish the CogAff schema from the

special case, presented briefly below.
<p>
It has other flaws that need to be remedied, in part by extending the analysis of ways in
which architectures can differ, in part inspired by the diversity produced by biological

<h3><b>
The CogAff Architecture Schema
<br/>
and the H-CogAff special case
</b></h3>
The name "CogAff" is used both for the project and as a label for a generic schema
proposed several years ago for a wide variety of architectures, natural and artificial.
(We don't claim it is general enough to cover all cases: some of the distinctions are not
fine-grained enough. But it illustrates a style of research on architectures that is
unfortunately rare.)
<p>
This Schema, as explained above, classifies requirements for the major components of an
architecture into nine broad categories on a 3x3 grid which can be connected together in
different ways (depending on how various kinds of information - factual information,
queries, control information, etc, flow between subsystems).
<p>
This is just a first crude sub-division, requiring more detailed analysis and further
decomposition of cases (as illustrated
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/fully-deliberative.html">here</a>). However it does cover
many different
types of architecture, natural and artificial, depicted rather abstractly above.
<p>
Architectures vary according to what mechanisms they have in the boxes, and how they are
connected. Also more complex architectures may have important subdivisions and possibly
may require functions that don't fit neatly into any of the boxes. (For example, it is
arguable that the mechanisms concerned with production and understanding of language, and
use of language for thinking and reasoning, are scattered over many different subsystems.)
<p>
The generic CogAff schema includes an important sub-class of architectures that include
mechanisms capable of producing what might be called "emotional" or "alarm" reactions, as
shown in the "insect-like" special case, above.
<p>
A much more
complex special case is the H-CogAff architecture, which we suggest
provides a very high level "birds-eye view" of the architecture of a typical
<br/>(adult) human
mind, depicted crudely here (as a first approximation):
<p>
<p>
<b>Fig H-Cogaff</b>
<img alt="CogAff" height="380"
src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/hcogaff.jpg"/>
<p>
<p>
<p>
It includes concurrently active sub-architectures that evolved at
different times
in our evolutionary history, in addition to
sub-architectures that grow themselves
during
individual development (as discussed in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/#tr0609">this paper</a>
by Chappell and
Sloman.)

The previous diagrams do not make it clear enough that perceptual and
action/motor mechanisms overlap. E.g. (as J.J.Gibson pointed out in <i>The
Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems</i> (1966)), mechanisms of vision depend
on the use of saccades, head movement, and whole body movements, and haptic
sensing depends on controlled movements of hands, tongue, lips, etc.

There are additional complexities not shown in the above diagrams, including the
architectural decomposition at each layer, the complex sub-architectures
straddling layers, e.g. for several different kinds of long term memory, for
vision, for behaviour initiation and motor control, for language use, for
learning, for many kinds of motivation, for personality formation, for social
and sexual interaction, and many more.

(Including "downward" causation")
<li>
Philosophy of Computation
<BR>
E.g. the nature of virtual machines, and how the implementation of virtual machines in
