<a name="what-is"></a>
<b>What is it?</b>
<br/>
Computer Science is a multi-faceted, still expanding, discipline. It straddles a
range of theoretical and applied fields, concerned with a wide variety of
natural and artificial
information-using systems, a wide variety of forms of information, a wide
variety of operations on information for many different purposes, and a wide
variety of mechanisms that enable such uses of information, including
mechanical, electronic, chemical, neural and <i>virtual</i> machinery.
<p>
Some uses of information are very simple such as the use of information by a
thermostat turning a heater on or off, or a Watt governor controlling the speed
of a steam engine. Note the subtle differences between the uses of energy and
the uses of information in such devices: the information is used to control how
much energy is used at any time.
<p>
Other uses are far more complex, such as the
use of information in a fertilised egg to produce an ant or an antelope.
<p>
Simple cases include
use of information about how to add numbers, built into a calculator, and
information about which numbers to add, provided by a user.
<p>
Uses of information in brains when when humans add numbers
mentally are much more complex cases.
<p>
Some of the mechanisms are products of recent technology, for instance, the
physical computers, the computer networks, and the virtual machines that run on
physical computers (like operating systems such as Android, Linux, MacOs and
Windows).
<p>
Others are ancient products of biological evolution including brains,
minds, ecosystems and socio-economic systems. All of these are concerned with
information -- either as part of what controls the processes, or as products of
the processes. The information may be used immediately, stored for
later use, or communicated to other information users, all of which require
supporting mechanisms.

<p>
Because of the
broad applicability of its concepts,
theories, and techniques, computer science increasingly overlaps with other
disciplines, in the same sort of way as mathematics has always done.
<p>
Information, expressed as computer programs and other information stores,
can be used to
control behaviours of man-made machines.
<p>
Information also controls living systems or parts of living systems, on many
scales, including controlling growth and development, regulation of processes
within individual cells, and planning a journey to a feeding site.
<p>
Information
can be <i>available</i> for use without ever <i>actually</i> being used by
anyone or anything and without being <i>intended</i> as a source of information.
For example, every structured object, whether a pebble on a beach, a portion of
the night sky, a tree, or an abstract mathematical structure, such as a perfect
cube or a collection of numbers, can be a source of information about the
object; and computer science includes the study of possible ways in which such
information can be acquired, represented, manipulated and used.
<p>
Computer science also includes
the study and use of both <b>artificially created</b>
information structures, such as airline time-tables,
and <b>naturally available</b> information, such as geological records.
<p>
In particular
it investigates how machines can acquire and use such information and, in
collaboration with other disciplines, investigates how organisms (including
humans) use information, for example in perception, formation of goals, making
plans to achieve goals, controlling behaviours in accordance with such plans,
and communicating with others.
<p>
A particularly hard problem is understanding the forms of computation in the
brains of ancient mathematicians that led to mathematical discoveries thousands
of years ago, that are still used today: e.g. discoveries in geometry and
arithmetic.
<p>
In both man-made machines and organisms there are <b>structures</b> (simple or
complex, physical or abstract, entities) that are constructed, examined,
manipulated, or transformed and <b>collections of instructions</b> specifying
what to do with those structures.
<p>
This has led some to propose slogans similar to:
<pre>
    Computation = Data + Control
               or Data + Algorithms
</pre>
However, individual instructions and whole programs are themselves structures
that can be operated on, e.g. when they are constructed, or when they are
investigated in order to understand design flaws, or when they are modified to
remove errors or to extend what the programs can do.
<p>
So computer science
includes investigation of programs that create, debug or modify programs. This
can include altering the algorithms, altering how data-structures are used to
encode information, and altering how different parts of a complex system are put
together (the information-processing <b>architecture</b>).

<p>
<a name="when"></a>
<b>When did it start?</b>
<br/>
Computer Science as we now know it was born in the first half of the 20th
Century.
<p>
But it has much older roots,
<br>
--
in ancient mathematics (including
algorithms),
<br>
--
in logic (including powerful forms of representation and
reasoning),
<br>
--
in philosophy (addressing hard questions about knowledge, reasoning,
mind and life),
<br>
--
in various forms of engineering &#8212; including mechanical
calculators, musical boxes, automated weaving machinery (such as the Jacquard
loom
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">(1801)</a>, and
machines for sorting statistical information encoded on 'punched cards', used
for the United States census in 1890, and for many business applications before
computers as we now know them existed, or were even thought of.
<p>
Unlike modern
general purpose computers, the older machines were restricted to following
instructions for particular sorts of tasks.
<p>
<b>Babbage and Lovelace</b>
<br>
The ideas of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/babbage_charles.shtml">Charles
Babbage</a> (1791 - 1871), who designed and partly built what he called his "Analytical
Engine", came very close to what we now understand by a general purpose stored
program computer.
<p>
Moreover his collaborator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>, who
understood many of the implications of the design, seems to have been the first
programmer, if we discount the ancient mathematicians who developed algorithms
to be executed by human computers!
<p>
Although earlier philosophers had asked
questions about whether machines can have minds, she seems to have been the
first to raise such philosophical questions about what programmable computers
can do.
<p>
<a name="who"></a>
<b>Who started it?</b>
<br/>
In the 20th Century, computer science ramped up with increasing speed, building
on theoretical work by Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Jacques Herbrand, Kurt
G&ouml;del, Alonzo Church, Emil Post, Alan Turing, Konrad Zuse, John von
Neumann, Claude Shannon, and many others.
<p>
Much of that work was concerned with development of mathematical models of
computation and investigation of properties of the models. For example, several
of the models that were defined differently turned out to have equivalent
problem-solving powers. This raised the question whether new, possibly still
unknown mechanisms, for example biological brain mechanisms, or chemical
computers, or quantum computers, might have greater powers.
<p>
There are still many questions with unknown answers.
<p>
<a name="natural"></a>
<b>Comparing powers of natural and artificial computers.</b>
<br/>
A recent variant of that question is whether the chemical computational
mechanisms that are essential for life, including construction of brains, and
were used by biological evolution to produce millions of different life forms,
including microbes and humans, have important features that digital computers
and neural computers both lack.
<p>
Most of computer science is now concerned with "general purpose" computers,
machines that differ in the details of their construction but can all, if
suitably programmed, perform the same range of computations (although they may
differ in their speed, their storage capacity, and their attached peripheral
devices, e.g. screens, video cameras, microphones, speakers, joysticks,
touch-pads, storage devices, etc.)
<p>
There are also special purpose computers that perform restricted tasks and in
some cases do so more cheaply or efficiently than the general purpose computers.
<p>
<a name="digital"></a>
<b>Digital (discrete, general purpose) and analog (continuous, special purpose)
computation</b>
<br/>
General purpose computers are all discrete, or digital, i.e. based on switches
that can be in discrete states, with discontinuous changes (e.g. between "on"
and "off" states).
<p>
Different combinations of switch states can be interpreted by
a central processor as expressing different instructions. The generality comes
from the ability of one physical machine to be given many different sets of
instructions that, when run, perform a wide variety of tasks, including, if
required, altering the programs
<p>
Not all digital
computers are general purpose, however, as some are hard-wired to perform a
fixed set of tasks (e.g. interpreting programs in a fixed 'machine language').
<p>
In contrast, many special purpose
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Analog_computer.html">analog computers</a>
are based on continuously varying physical states, such as voltages,
currents, electrical resistance, or pressures and flow of fluids.
<p>
Discreteness
can ensure total predictability of a computer (while it works), and that
predictability can be of great importance for users. But there are significant
costs associated with synchronising large numbers of switches, and research on
analog computers continues, although they are not included in all computer
science courses.
<p>
<a name="practical"></a>
<b>From theory to practical engineering</b>
<br/>
Early computer science research was mainly theoretical, but during and after
World War 2 electronic computers became increasingly important and made many new
practical applications possible, including the famous code-breaking work in
Bletchley Park.
<p>
Advances in physics, materials science, and electrical
engineering, and later on computer-controlled design and manufacturing, made it
possible to develop ever smaller, cheaper and more powerful computing machines,
with ever-increasing complexity, and with much lower energy requirements than
their predecessors.
<p>
Challenging requirements of large businesses, military organisations and
research laboratories also led to development of networks linking many computers
together, performing a variety of different functions collaboratively, often
distributed across continents, as in the Internet, begun in the early 1970s,
supporting the World Wide Web, since about 1900.
<p>
The rise of linked computers accessible from all over this planet (and possibly
beyond) raised many problems about privacy and security, which now form a major
part of computer science.
<p>
Geographical separation of components of an integrated system raises new
theoretical and practical problems for computer science, for instance concerning
efficiency and reliability.
<p>
While theoretical computer science and computer systems engineering, along with
their applications, all expanded, more and more sciences and industries used
computing machines and computing techniques for doing calculations, making
predictions, designing and controlling complex systems, interpreting complex
data, solving mathematical problems, finding mathematical proofs, and developing
new engineering applications -- including "distributed" applications using the
internet and world-wide web.
<p>
Not
all of them used digital computers. For some applications, electrical or
mechanical continuous, or hybrid, control mechanisms can be effective, like the
Watt centrifugal governor, many temperature controllers, and self-aligning
windmills, e.g. with large vanes to capture physical energy from wind, and small
vanes to acquire and use information about wind direction, as depicted below
(with thanks to Wikimedia):

</center>
<p>
<a name="influence"></a>
<b>Influence on other sciences</b>
<br/>
As knowledge about computation spread, more and more sciences that had been
established earlier began to absorb ideas from computer science, including
mathematics, philosophy, psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, social sciences,
economics, biology, medicine, physics and chemistry.
<p>
At first these applications were restricted to processing records of data from
experiments or surveys, and in some cases controlling machines performing
scientific experiments, but gradually it was realised that computer programs
could be used to formulate powerful explanatory theories about the workings of
mechanisms that could not be directly observed or measured, for example theories
about how brains understand language or process visual information, or theories
about unobservable processes inside stars or theories about how tornadoes form,
or  how cancer cells grow.
<p>
As a result, there have been increased opportunities for students in many
scientific and engineering disciplines to learn to use computers, and many of
them learn to use a programming language (or program development environment) to
express algorithms composed of instructions telling a computer what to do with
some starting information -- which may include problem statements, collections
of numbers, collections of symbolic records, collections of images, speech
recordings, or other information structures.
<p>
One of the major scientific successes was the Human Genome Project, which used
computer controlled laboratory procedures and computer-based analysis of the
results: a use of artificial information processing systems to help us
understand natural information processing systems: human reproductive
mechanisms.
<p>
More recently the Large Hadron Collider has been using computation to control
and interpret results of very complex physical experiments.
<p>
Unfortunately the kind of programming education offered students in
non-computing disciplines often produces narrowly focused technical expertise
without providing a deep understanding of the scope of computational systems and
problems, or the variety of types of programming languages and the reasons for
their existence, topics that are part of a balanced computer science education.
<p>
<a name="living"></a>
<b>Computational models of living systems</b>
<br/>
Relations between inputs and outputs (sensory and motor signals) cannot
summarise the complex internal computations involved in animal perception,
learning, reasoning, planning, problem-solving, language learning, and
socialisation. We need to build working models to test psychological theories
with deep explanatory power.
<p>
Biological theories about how organisms reproduce, grow, acquire new
capabilities, fight infections, repair damage, etc. are all concerned with
information and the use of information in control mechanisms of many kinds.
<p>
For these reasons, computational ideas have become increasingly important
in the 21st century, in sciences that study living things, since varieties of
types of information, forms of representation of information, and mechanisms for
manipulating and using information are essential to understanding living things.
So life scientists increasingly use ideas from computer science and have begun
to contribute new ideas.
<p>
It is now commonplace to regard mechanisms of evolution, reproductive
mechanisms, mechanisms controlling growth of plants and animals, the mechanisms
involved in cancer and other diseases, the operations of animal nervous systems
and the workings of human minds as involving information-processing
mechanisms.
<p>
Those mechanisms and their products cannot be understood using older research
methodologies based on looking for patterns in observational and experimental
data -- for example records of human responses to stimuli in laboratories:
there's far too much going on (in brains) between the stimuli and the responses.
<p>
The intervening processes cannot be so readily observed, so great creativity and
imaginative design ability is required to come up with good new explanatory
theories.
<p>
Unfortunately such creativity is often limited by academic fasions!
<p>
The processes by which complex structures grow, change their form, interact with
other structures, compete for resources, and in some cases interfere with the
operation of other mechanisms, cannot be understood using the ideas in older
scientific theories that link a fixed number of variables in a mathematical
formula, like Newton's F=M&times;A, or Ohm's law: Voltage=Current&times;Resistance.
<p>
<a name="languages"></a>
<b>Why are there so many different programming languages?</b>
<br/>
The diversity of practical and theoretical applications of computing has
inspired the development of a large variety of programming languages and
programming methodologies that differ in important ways.
<p>
This diversity, and the need for future diversity, is not
served well by an educational system that teaches a narrow subset of
programming languages.
<p>
Allowing different teachers to focus on different languages and uses of
computation could produce a much richer and more varied community of scientists,
engineers and other thinkers using computers.
<p>
<a name="tasks"></a>
<b>Varieties of programming tasks</b>
<br/>
In the simplest programming task, an algorithm (an organised collection of
instructions) is applied to some pre-existing information structure, which could
be a single number whose square root is to be computed, or millions of data
items to be analysed statistically, or a mathematical question to be answered by
a calculation, or an algebraic expression whose correctness is to be checked, or
some measurements and control signals in a machine that is managed  by
the computer (e.g. a thermostatic temperature controller that sets different
target temperatures at different times each week, or a chemical plant, doing
many more things in parallel!).
<p>
The instructions in an algorithm may start by inspecting the information given
and performing operations, often creating new temporary information structures
used to obtain a final result. The process may or may not terminate, and if it
terminates it may or may not give the right answer. The cleverer, and more
careful, the programmer the more likely the answer is to be correct.
<p>
Other applications don't start with a fixed collection of information or a fixed
information structure, but continually acquire more information, and use that
for some purpose, which might be learning patterns in the information stream, or
might simply be continuously controlling some machine in the light of the data
-- for example, keeping an airliner flying at a specified altitude, in a
specified direction, at a specified speed, despite continuous changes in
surrounding atmospheric conditions, or maintaining the temperature and humidity
of air in a building.
<p>
<a name="diversity"></a>
<b>The diversity of applied computing</b>
<br/>
Because there are many different sorts of computational problem, different
kinds of programming language and computational architecture are best suited
to different problems. For example, some problems break down into sub-problems,
that in turn break down into still-smaller sub-problems, so that if the original
problem is complex its solution may involve solution of very large sets of
sub-problems.
<p>
A computer scientist may discover that in some cases the same sub-problem is
repeatedly generated when solving a big problem. So if the system is able to
detect when a new sub-problem is the same as one already solved, and to re-use
the previously found solution, then that could in some cases enormously reduce
the number of steps required to solve problems.
<p>
This requires the programming language used to be able to compare specifications
of problems and programs, to decide whether a new problem is a variant of an old
one, whose solution can be re-used, possibly in a slightly different form.
(Until fairly recently, only humans could take such decisions.)
<p>
<a name="expressive"></a>
<b>Expressive power of programming languages</b>
<br>
[Too advanced -- remove? or improve and clarify.]
<br/>
For some programming languages and some machine architectures it may be very
difficult to use that strategy for simplifying problems, whereas other
programming languages and computer architectures (e.g. with support for
'memo-functions') may provide excellent support for such techniques, allowing
quick answers to ever more complex questions of the form "have I previously
encountered and solved problem (......) and if so what was the result?".
<p>
Identifying types of problem, and the types of machine or programming language
that are good for different problem types is a very different task from
designing particular algorithms for particular problems, emphasised in some
answers to the question 'What is computer science?'
<p>
There is no standard
algorithm for developing new algorithms to solve novel problems. Finding a good
solution often requires a deep understanding not only of computing but also of
the application domain, and a great deal of programmer creativity.
<p>
There is research
in Artificial Intelligence aimed at giving computers that kind of creativity,
though so far this can be done only for special types of problem that human
designers understand well.
<p>
There are also cases where 'self-modifying' programs can study their own
successes and failures and learn which sorts of change improve a program and
which sorts make it worse. But it may take much more research to produce
machines that are as good as the best human programmers at creating and
modifying programs -- and getting better at doing that as they gain experience
and understanding.
<p>
<a name="stature"></a>
<b>The stature of computer science</b>
<br/>
Partly as a result of its significance for many other sciences, Computer Science
is now comparable in stature to all the other major sciences and mathematics --
attracting some of the leading thinkers of our time.
<p>
The physical sciences study forms of matter and energy in our universe, and
their interactions. The life sciences study forms and mechanisms of life,
including individual organisms, societies and ecosystems, and their interactions
with living and non-living matter. The science of <i>computation</i> studies,
among other things, the bridge between the two: namely <i>information</i>, and
the ways in which it can be represented, derived, transformed, combined,
created, transmitted and above all <b>used</b>.
<p>
The subjects of such study can include
<ul>
<li>
the simplest organisms as they
reproduce and control their reactions to their immediate environment,
<li>
the
most complex organisms as they perceive, learn, act and communicate, and
<li>
advanced, increasingly intelligent, forms of technology that now dominate our
industries, our social interactions, the latest medical advances, and powerful
tools of thought.
</ul>
<p>
This vision of computation was already clear to one of the founders of computer
science, Alan Turing, in the early 1950s, when computers were still in their
infancy. He even foresaw the development of artificial intelligence (AI) which
now plays a crucial role in many widely used systems, and also raises deep
philosophical questions about the nature of mind.
<p>
He also made important
contributions to computational modelling of biological processes of development
(morphogenesis), which have recently begun to inspire mathematicians and
physicists to explore such processes.
<p>
Recently, growing appreciation of the importance of computer science and
computational thinking in many fields has led to a major revision of the content
of computing education in UK schools, and a rapidly growing community of
teachers and others concerned with the role of computing as a school subject.
Thousands of teachers and many others have joined an organisation that aims to
ensure that far more future school leavers, and later on university graduates,
will be equipped to contribute to computer science research, or to development
and use of sophisticated computational ideas and techniques in other fields:
