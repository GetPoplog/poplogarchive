<h3><b>
SHORT ANSWER
</b></h3>

The physical sciences study all the forms of matter and energy in
our universe, and their interactions.
<p>
The life sciences study all the forms of life, including individual
organisms, societies and ecosystems, and their interactions with
living and non-living matter.
<p>
The science of <i>computation</i> studies the bridge between the two:
<br/>
-- <i>information</i>, and the ways in which it can be represented,
derived, transformed, combined, created, transmitted and above
all <b>used</b> -- whether in the simplest organisms as they reproduce or
the most complex organisms as they perceive, learn and act, or
in advanced, increasingly intelligent, forms of technology that
now dominate our industries, our social interactions, the latest
medical advances, and powerful tools of thought.
<p>
This vision of computation was already clear to one of the founders
of computer science, Alan Turing, in the early 1950s, when computers
were still in their infancy.
<p>
Teaching and research in Computing in this university straddles
all those aspects of computer science, including their philosophical
and mathematical as well as scientific and practical implications.

Maggie Boden is a world authority in the field of artificial intelligence - she
even has a robot named in her honour.
Research Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex, Maggie has
spent a lifetime attempting to answer philosophical questions about the nature
of the human mind, but from a computational viewpoint.
"Tin cans", as she sometimes calls computers, are information processing
systems, the perfect vehicle, she believes, to help us understand, explore and
analyse the mind.
But questions about the human mind and the human person could never be answered
within one single academic subject. So the long career of Maggie Boden is the
very epitome of cross-disciplinary working. From medicine, to psychology, to
cognitive and computer science, to technology and philosophy, Professor Boden
has spent decades straddling multiple academic subjects, helping to create brand
new disciplines along the way.
