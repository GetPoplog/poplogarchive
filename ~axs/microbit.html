<h3><b>
Some thoughts and concerns about the Microbit
</b></h3>
<p>
I watched part of the presentation on Saturday morning (20th June) at
<a href="http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/index.php?id=cas-conference-2015-draft-programme">the CAS
(Computing at School)
2015 conference</a>
and
was not at all convinced that the Microbit had been designed by people with a
deep understanding of the diversity of needs of learners or teachers, and I
thought it quite absurd that something still being developed by possibly
excellent programmers but obviously far from ready, was going to be offered to
millions of school kids backed by the (in this case spurious) authority of the
BBC without first having been tried, tested, and criticised by a cohort of
experienced teachers with a wide range of backgrounds, expertise and confidence
levels.
<p>
Apart from the risks of immaturity of the product (evident on Saturday) I think
a nation that commits itself to monolithic educational strategies will produce
yet another generation that has a blinkered view of what's possible. The future
is so open and uncertain that we need a wide variety of approaches to teaching,
especially in a field that changes as rapidly as computing. Thanks to CAS this
variety seems to have been growing and flourishing in the last few years.
There's nothing wrong with trying to add to the variety: but the motivation
behind Microbit seems to be more like trying to replace everything else being
used for beginners. That would not matter so much if it did not have the backing
of the BBC!
<p>
Any experienced teacher will know that children vary widely in their interests
and abilities. One child may like to learn how to make a machine flash lights
and make noises. Another may enjoy exploring properties of numbers through
programming. Another may wish to program a physical or graphical turtle, or
group of turtles. Yet another may enjoy programming a chatbot using a simple
pattern-based language (and later grow up to be a famous theoretical linguist,
or psychologist, or philosopher).
<p>
Moreover, teachers also have different interests and aptitudes and creative
ideas and a national educational policy should find ways to build on that, not
squash all teachers down a narrow funnel.
<p>
Automatically giving such a system such wide distribution (millions of
learners), without a proper period of trial and debugging of both design and
implementation, implies that everything else is worthless, which is both
insulting and potentially demoralising to the many people who have already been
developing, testing or using teaching support packages of high quality, in many
cases tried and used with great enthusiasm and success by teachers.
<p>
Yet another case of excessive hubris? That's ok for commercial products people
can check out and decide to buy or not to buy. But not when the minds of our
children are the target - and the BBC is doing the launching.
<p>

<hr/>
<p>
I hope it is clear that I am not criticising the Microbit, only the process by
which it is being launched, which, among other things, risks being grossly
unfair to the many others who have already poured time, resources (and their
hearts) into developing tools, teaching ideas, and machinery in support of the
wonderful process launched by the ComputingAtSchool group, but without having
the advantage of the resources and prestige of the BBC. (I am not one of them,
in case anyone is wondering whether I have a vested interest.)
<p>
I am also somewhat reminded of many IT projects (e.g.
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/18/nhs-records-system-10bn">NHS projects</a>
among others) that have flopped (often at great public expense) because they
were not based on adequate requirements analysis and testing in close
collaboration with all the relevant types of user. Of course, sometimes a genius
designer does not need that consultation (e.g. the designer of Velcro?). But
that is rare.
<p>
A very important aspect of 'Computational Thinking', often ignored, or the
difficulties underestimated, is understanding the need for <font color="blue">deep</font> requirements
analysis, especially for systems designed to be used by a wide variety of types
of people, or systems designed to model or explain some very complex natural
phenomenon (e.g. cognitive development in toddlers <a href="#toddler">[*]</a>):

<b>NOTE ON THE BBC MICRO:</b>
<br>
(Not in the version on the CAS community web site.)
<br>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a> was
produced in a collaboration between the Acorn Computer company and the BBC in
1981, and was highly valued by many teachers and learners (though in many
schools there was nobody who could teach computing, so the machines they
acquired were wasted, unless bright pupils were let loose on them).
<p>
A new version of the already widely used BASIC programming language (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC</a>)
was developed for the machine, which supported procedures with proper local
variables, and therefore full recursion, a great improvement on previous
versions of BASIC. Unfortunately the opportunity to go even further and add
support for list processing, which would have given far better resources for
teaching AI programming (including modelling language understanding, and logical
reasoning processes) was missed, even though people elsewhere were already using
such languages successfully for teaching introductory AI courses, e.g. in the
USA and at Edinburgh and Sussex Universities (among others) in the UK.
<p>
Despite the virtues of the BBC micro, its use did not last and grow as it should
have done, mainly because ill informed critics (including, according to my
memories, politicians, people in business and industry, and some parents)
complained that school-kids were not being taught to use the machines that they
would encounter in future jobs, which at that time meant IBM PCs running a
microsoft operating system and business tools like word processors and
spreadsheets, not programming tools. This produced 30 years of serious damage to
our educational system, which CAS (Computing At School) has been undoing, with
spectacular results in the last few years.

There were several others, including machines sold mainly as word processors.
Also during that period Unix based systems were taking off, especially Sun
workstations and servers (using the highly prophetic slogan "The Network is the
Computer"), and Bleasdale computers in the UK.

This list is far from complete. A major piece of the story of that decade
concerns IBM's failure (or their lawyers' failure!) to understand what they were
allowing Microsoft to do to them.
