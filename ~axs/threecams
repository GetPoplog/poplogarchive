The information below was mostly written in May-June 2005. I have
recently upgraded my Dell D610 to use Fedora Core 5. What I had to do to
get the webcam to work is documented

EXPERIMENTS WITH THREE WEBCAMS
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/">Aaron Sloman</a>
</B></H2>

I have been trying to find a cheap webcam that works with linux, in
order to be able to do experiments
on vision (related to our work on
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/PlayMate-start.html">the CoSy PlayMate scenario</a>) while working at home or travelling.
<P>
Our
robotics teaching lab uses the egg-shaped Philips cameras (PWC) that
work by default on many linux systems with a very low resolution
(160x120), and for higher resolution require a driver that is the
subject of some
<a href="http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/">controversy</a>.
<P>
I could not get the proprietary driver to work on my laptop or desktop
machine running redhat 9. However after installing Fedora core 3, I
found that the Philips web cam worked up to the full VGA resolution
(640x480), provided I used the right tool (spcagui -- see below) to
interact with it.
<br>
See NOTE below about new pwc driver, in the tools section.

<P>
I also tried two cheap USB webcams available at PCWorld,

<UL>
<LI>
The Trust 150 Spacecam Portable
<br>
    <a href="http://www.trust.com/products/product.aspx?artnr=13405">http://www.trust.com/products/product.aspx?artnr=13405</a>
<BR>
    <a href="http://www.dabs.com/uk/shopbybrand/trust/webcams/ProductView.htm?quicklinx=2FJ9">http://www.dabs.com/uk/shopbybrand/trust/webcams/ProductView.htm?quicklinx=2FJ9</a>
<BR>
This cost £14.99 at PCWorld.
<P>
This is recognized by software as being a Sonix sn9c10x webcam. I found
a project to provide a driver for sn9c10x (search for
sn9c102-1.24.tar.gz) but could not get it to work. However the Trust
webcam, like the PCline webcam, works with the spca5xx driver -- which
supports multiple cameras (see below).

<P>

<LI>
The PCline W310 Webcam (USB VGA Webcam), with built-in microphone.
<br>
This is apparently a PCline-branded variant on the
    Mustek Wcam300a Zc0301
    <a href="http://www.epcbuyer.com/products.asp?partno=webcam_mustek300a">http://www.epcbuyer.com/products.asp?partno=webcam_mustek300a</a>

which seems to be available from various suppliers.
<BR>
It also cost £14.99
at PCWorld (I may have taken the last one from the selly oak PCworld)
</UL>

Sample pictures
</B></H2>
The 'dim light' pictures were taken using only artificial light with a
ceiling lamp (shown in some of the pictures) and an upward pointing
standard lamp set well below its maximum level.

<BR>
It may be hard to believe but the last set of pictures, produced by the
Philips webcam, was taken in the same location using the same lighting
as the PCline and Trust pictures in dim light.
<P>
<a href="pwc/pwc-fc3-dell-spcagui.jpg">This picture</a> was taken
using the Philips webcam on my Dell D600 laptop after I upgraded the
operating system from Redhat 9 to Fedora Core 3, and then added a
further kernel upgrade to get the latest version of 'Software suspend
(SWSUSP). I used the latest pwc driver version pwc-10.0.6a, kindly sent
to me by Ales Stimec. The picture shows the spcagui interface to the
camera, along with a portion of the current picture being displayed to
the right of the interface. The picture was taken by clicking on the
gui. It is also possible to start and stop a movie, and also to
change the resolution displayed, by clicking on the gui.
</UL>

For more on movies, see below.

<H2><B>
Summary evaluation (static pictures)
</B></H2>
The Trust webcam is generally not as good as the PCLine webcam in good
light. The Trust works with the spca5xx driver though only at a lower
resolution than the PCline webcam. However the Trust takes better
pictures than the PCline in dim light.
<P>
Also in some circumstances which I have not pinned down, but may be
connected with the brightness of the ambient light, when the pcline
camera is used in large window (VGA) mode the display sometimes goes
crazy. When it is used with spcagui, this can be stopped by using the
contrast slider to reduce the contrast. When it used with spcaview there
does not seem to be any parameter or interactive control that suppresses
the problem, unfortunately.

<P>
The PCline webcam is quite good in good light, but neither the Trust or
PCline can compete with the Philips Webcam (which also costs more,
though I don't have a recent price). There are probably newer models
which supersede and will work with the same pwc driver.
<P>

<H2><B>
Tools used
</B></H2>
The Philips webcam required the pwc driver that came with Fedora Core 3
and in a less useful form in Redhat 9.
<BR>
<B>NOTE</B> After I upgraded to the 2.6.11 kernel with software suspend
as described in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/dell-d600-fc3.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/dell-d600-fc3.html</a>
I had to use a newer version of the PWC driver, namely
pwc-10.0.6a, e.g. available here
<a href="http://grubald.free.fr/linux3114a/raoul/pwc-10.0.6a.tar.bz2.tar">http://grubald.free.fr/linux3114a/raoul/pwc-10.0.6a.tar.bz2.tar</a>

<P>
For the PCline and Trust webcams I used the spca5xx driver which
compiled and installed very easily on both my desktop PC running FC 3,
and my Dell Latitude D600 laptop running RedHat 9 (soon to be upgraded
to FC3).
<P>
The spca5xx driver is available from
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/apropos.html">Michel Xhaard's</a>
Open Source web site, on the download page
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html">http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html</a>

<P>
I fetched the spca5xx driver, which I compiled and installed (using just
two commands 'make' followed by 'make install', the latter as root) on
both my desktop machine running FC3 and my Dell laptop running redhat 9
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/spca5xx-20050501.tar.gz">http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/spca5xx-20050501.tar.gz</a>
<BR>
Michel's programs simply compiled and ran first time. All the
configuration checking (e.g. whether running on a 2.4 or 2.6 linux
kernel) was done in the makefiles and the C source code.

<P>
I was very
impressed, especially in view of the variety of cameras supported.
<P>
I also fetched two more excellent tools, namely spcaview, described in
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/sview.html">http://mxhaard.free.fr/sview.html</a>
downloadable from
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/spcaview-20050501.tar.gz">http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/spcaview-20050501.tar.gz</a>

<P>
and spcagui, downloadable from
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/spcagui20050108.tar.gz">http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/spcagui20050108.tar.gz</a>
<P>
NOTE: there are pointers to newer versions of these tools below.
<P>

The spcagui program provides a control panel with sliders and buttons
that make it easy to select different display formats (e.g. different
display resolutions), different output formats (JPG, YUV, and others),
adjust brightness, contrast and colour, take snapshots in the chosen
output format, or make .avi movies (which are very large files).
<P>
The spcaview program can also be used to display what the camera sees,
to take snapshots, to take a sequence of snapshots at 1 second intervals
or greater, to take a sequence output into a single .avi file, or to
make .avi movies (use -z for compression, since otherwise the files are
huge).

<P>
<H2><B>
MOVIES
</B></H2>
The following two commands, used with the Philips webcam, produced
compressed pseudo-movies using 20 frames at 1 second intervals, where
the '-z' option causes compression and the '-l' option increases the
display size to VGA (and therefore also increases the file size)

<UL>
<LI> spcaview -N 20 -z -g -o pwc-movie1.avi
<BR>
produced
    <a href="pwc-movies/pwc-movie1.avi">pwc-movie1.avi 206742 bytes</a>

<P>
<LI> spcaview -l -N 20 -z -g -o pwc-movie2.avi
<BR>
produced
    <a href="pwc-movies/pwc-movie2.avi">pwc-movie2.avi 604200 bytes</a>
</UL>

The '-g' option (grab instead of using mmap) did not seem to make any
difference that I could detect. (On 2ghz AMD Athlon64 using Fedora Core
3).

<P>
Two more 'real' movies (i.e. 'continous recording') were created using
spcaview and spcagui. The first was compressed by giving spcaview the -z
flag. The second was recorded using spcagui by clicking on the video
record icon to start and to stop recording (I don't know if there is a
compress option) It is about 16 Mbytes in size, so I have compressed it
using bzip2. Download then uncompress with 'bunzip2 file.bz2'

These movies made by spcagui and spcaview cannot be played using my
installed versions of xine and mplayer, but they can be played using

<PRE>
    spcaview -i file.avi
</PRE>

Compatibility with xawtv
</B></H2>
The PCline works with spcaview and spcagui, but not with xawtv.
<P>
The Trust works with xawtv, provided it is given the right arguments
<PRE>
xawtv -nogl -nodga
</PRE>
and and also works with spcagui, though you have to select the right
input mode. It works with spcaview only if given a size argument:
<PRE>
    spcaview -s 352x288
</PRE>
<P>
The Philips works with spcaview and spcagui, but not with xawtv.
<P>
I know nothing about camera technology, and nothing about image or video
file formats, so I don't understand any of this. Perhaps I was not
giving the right arguments in the cases where the cameras did not work.
<P>
The documentation for spcagui is very sparse. Even the '-h' flag gives
very little information, though this is compensated for by the almost
self-explanatory GUI controls.
<P>
On the other hand 'spcaview -h' gives quite a lot of information.
<P>

NOTE
</B></H2>
At the time of writing (22 May 2005) there are new (test?) versions of
spca5xx, spcagui and spcaview in
<a href="http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Doc/allinone/">http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Doc/allinone/</a>
<BR>
I have fetched them and they all seem fine.
