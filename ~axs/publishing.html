Dear colleagues,
<p>
Don't let publishers and copy-editors bully you into accepting their often illogical
and distorting changes to your text.
<p>
Insist that you will not allow your paper to be included in their books and journals
unless you have the ultimate say on what the content is, and no copy editor should be
allowed to make any change without asking you <i>first</i>.

<p>
Unfortunately, too many of the copy-editors who are employed to work on scientific or
academic texts are both ignorant of the subject matter and slavishly committed to
following out of date stylistic rules that may be relevant to literary essays written
a hundred years ago but have no relevance to modern scientific and academic
communication, and when applied blindly to your text can seriously change the sense
of what you had written. (Examples below.)
<p>
It is not easy to notice such changes, especially without electronic tools to point
up differences between original and new version, and some dreadful alterations of
meaning resulting from something as simple as insertion or removal of a comma have
got through to the final published version because I did not spot them when reading
paper proofs. Human brains did not evolve for proof-reading.
<p>
<a name="MDPI-example"></a>
<b>Note added 3 May 2018:</b>
<br>
I am pleased to say that I have just received the edited proof of a paper for
the MDPI journal <i>Information</i>, where all the main changes were clearly
marked by colour changes in the PDF file, and most of the changes were
acceptable. However, as often happens, multiple spurious commas had been
inserted after "e.g.", blindly following an out of date style rule criticised <a href="#example">below</a>
for confusing parenthetical and forward referring uses of "for example" or "e.g.".
<p>
<font color="blue">
But when I pointed out the error of confusing those two uses, the MDPI Editor
immediately removed all the unwanted commas, and said they would pass on the
information about the distinction to their copy editors. The article  is online
here, as evidence:
<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/9/5/111">http://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/9/5/111</a>
</font>
<p>
You may be afraid to resist copy-editors because too often job applications, tenure
or promotion depend on numbers of publications, but if we all put our foot down,
publishers will have to take note.
<p>
It's <b>your</b> work: don't let them spoil it and make you waste your time resisting or
undoing their attempts to spoil it.

<p>
I hope more people will join an anti-copy-editing resistance army, so that in
future we can suffer less from time-wasting and often also intrusive and
corrosive attempts to mangle our manuscripts (driven by somebody's rule-book
rather than common sense and an understanding of communication), while leaving
it open for those who are not expert in the language to use their help. I have
been reading, writing, and speaking English, and teaching in English for over
three quarters of a century. Although I make some mistakes, I don't see why
publishers should give someone with an inferior grasp of the language, and a
lack of relevant technical knowledge concerning the content of what I have
written, freedom to make whatever changes they like without even asking my
permission or marking the proposed changes so that I can find them quickly.
<p>
This is extreme discourtesy and inconsiderateness. Unfortunately, this
dictatorial procedure is what most publishers seem to think is their right.
<p>
Of course, I have no objection to people who are less experienced and less
confident in their use of English willingly handing over responsibility for
improving style, spelling and clarity to an expert. But that should be an
explicitly agreed option, not the default procedure.

<b>50 Years of Stupid Grammar Advice</b>
<br>
By Geoffrey K. Pullum,
<br>
Professor of General Linguistics Edinburgh University.


<blockquote>
Apparently Strunk & White's <i>The Elements of Style</i> (first
edition 1918; most recent Pearson Education Company, 2000)
is widely used by teachers in the USA. I think this devastating (and funny)
criticism should be a warning to all who believe that something that is widely
recommended must be good.
<p>
This is how Pullum's review starts:
<blockquote>
<i>
"April 16 is the 50th anniversary of the publication of a little book that is
loved and admired throughout American academe. Celebrations, readings, and
toasts are being held, and a commemorative edition has been released.
<p>
I won't be celebrating. ......"
</i>
</blockquote>
Nor I, after reading what he had to say about the book, including:
<blockquote>
<i>
 Its advice ranges from limp platitudes to inconsistent nonsense. Its enormous
influence has not improved American students' grasp of English grammar; it has
significantly degraded it.
</i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="battle"></a>
<h3><b>
Some battles to be won
</b></h3>
<a name="numbered"></a>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Numbered sections aid communication</b>
<br>
There are publishers or at least their copy editors (especially in the USA I suspect)
who have been rigidly trained using a 100 year old style guide (The Chicago Guide?)
and understand nothing about scientific communication and the need to include
sensible cross-references in a paper of any substance, instead of the vague use of
'above' and 'below', or 'previously' and 'later', etc. So they insist on having
section headings that are not numbered.
<p>
OUP in the USA are an example, and it seriously limits the usefulness for teaching
and research of a book like
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/03.html#200305"> Who Needs Emotions?: The Brain Meets the Robot, (Eds. M. Arbib and J-M. Fellous). </a>
<blockquote>
<small>
I was glad to find that OUP in the UK are more sensible, and allowed Margaret Boden
to use numbered sections in her <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/boden-mindasmachine.html">two volume history of cognitive science.</a>
</small>
</blockquote>
Even <a href="http://www.aaai.org">the AAAI</a> does not allow numbered sections in its conference and workshop
publications, alas. (Note 2016: This may now be out of date.)
<p>
<a name="citations"></a>
<li>
<b>Numeric citations hinder communication</b>
<br>
Another dreadful publishing house style is to use the [1], [2] etc. citation
convention. It saves space but it is dreadful for readers, as you have no hope of
recognising the citation without going to the list of references, which can waste a
lot of time. It is made worse by the need to list things in order of mention rather
than alphabetically, so that it can be extremely tiresome to check whether a
particular author is referenced in a paper with a long list of references. Why on
earth should scientific communicators allow publishers to replace things like
'Einstein(1905)' with [35]?
<p>
<a name="quotation"></a>
<li>
<b>It's time to sort out the logic of quotation marks.</b>
<br>
I shall never start up a journal, but if I ever did I'd have quite a long list of
things I would require the publisher to agree to in advance, including allowing
authors to put periods in the right (logical) place after quotations like "Paris in
the spring". The rule that commas and periods should go before the final quotation
mark is appropriate only to novels that quote what people say, in which case whole
sentences including period or question mark should go inside. Someone may object:
"But we have been doing it the other way for years."  That may be their response but
it's time to learn that logic and clarity are sometimes more important than tradition
and uniformity. (That's an example where the convention is arguably OK: the period
ends a whole sentence that is quoted, though there is still an argument that the
sentence containing it does not end till after the quote mark, and so another period
should come there!)
<p>
Compare: Why did you shout "Stop at once!" ? The exclamation mark is part of the
content of what is quoted and goes inside. The question mark is not, and goes
outside.
<p>
Likewise this is sensible
<pre>
    Is his name "Tom", "Tommy" or "Thomas"?
</pre>
whereas this is illogical:
<pre>
    Is his name "Tom," "Tommy" or "Thomas?"
</pre>

What is right for a novel full of quoted verbal interactions is not right for a
scientific or philosophical article where a quoted item, such as ",", or a
phrase, such as "or a phrase", is as much an indivisible unit as a word. Would
you put periods or commas before the last letter of a word? The logic of the
brain-clamped rule about quotations would have required me to use the following
absurd form instead of what I wrote above:
<blockquote>
... a quoted item, such as ",," or a
phrase, such as "or a phrase," ...
</blockquote>
<a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Writing/p.html#punctuation">In Jack Lynch's guide</a> it is clear that he understands that the standard usage is
illogical, but recommends sticking with it because "it's what publishers expect".
Well, since that's the only reason, it's time we started educating publishers so that
we can teach our children and our students to think and write logically instead of
blindly following arbitrary rules.
<p>
<a name="secular-web"></a>
<b>NOTE ADDED 28 Jul 2012: The Secular Web</b>
<br>
I was surprised and disappointed to find that a web site as rational and liberated as
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/">The Secular Web</a> owned and operated by <a href="http://www.infidels.org/infidels/">Internet Infidels, Inc.</a>
insists on enforcing such an irrational punctuation convention (apparently on the
sole grounds that that's the American way to do
things). See
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/infidels/errors.html">http://www.infidels.org/infidels/errors.html</a>
<p>
They also have a rule forbidding hyphens after various prefixes including 'meta'.
That kind of (religious?) rigidity is out of place in a world where there are already
some established conventions. For example one of my PhD students invented a concept
of "meta-management" and people searching for references using the hyphen will get
fewer miss-hits than those searching without the hyphen.
<p>
Likewise, I've invented a concept
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/meta-morphogenesis.html">"meta-morphogenesis"</a>
and I use the hyphen to prevent misinterpretation of the term as if it were
"metamorpho-genesis", or "metamorph-ogenesis", i.e. something to do with
creation, or emergence of something called "metamorph". If anyone from The
Secular Web reads this I hope they will reconsider their rigidity. (I wholly
endorse their main aims, however: see my
<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/BhamCog/misc/varieties-of-atheism.html">http://tinyurl.com/BhamCog/misc/varieties-of-atheism.html</a>)

<p>

<a name="commas"></a>
<li>
<b>Pressure to insert spurious commas should be resisted</b>
<br>
Another rule that is apparently taught to some copy-editors is insisting that
"yet", when starting a concessive/adversative clause, must always be followed by
a comma, yet, they do not realise how illogical this is (as in this clause) --
just as silly as inserting a comma after "but", but they would not do that (as I
haven't here).
<p>
I don't object to people who want to insert the spurious comma in their own
writings, but trying to make others do it is unjustifiably dictatorial.
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b>
<br>
These are not merely transatlantic disagreements. For example, I found a mostly
excellent style guide at the University of Guelph (in Canada) <a href="http://www.learningcommons.uoguelph.ca/WritingServices/Fastfacts-ImprovingPunctuation.html">here,</a>
which makes many
of the same points as I am making, though they do recommend the illogical rule
about inserting commas and periods before closing quotation marks, while
requiring semi-colons and colons to go after. WHY???
<p>
Why do for quotation marks what they would never dream of doing for brackets?
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="oxford-commas"></a>
<li>
<b>Oxford commas (Serial commas)</b>
<br>
There are disputes over whether a comma should or should not be used just before
"and" or "or" when there are more than two items listed. E.g.
<blockquote>
"Tom, Dick, and Harry" and "Tom, Dick, or Harry"
<i>versus</i>
"Tom, Dick and Harry" and "Tom, Dick or Harry".
</blockquote>

My own view is that in most contexts it does not matter which is used; and
bothering to insist on uniformity on this is a waste of human energy and brain
power. However, there are some contexts where the comma helps to reduce
ambiguity, e.g. where the items listed are represented not by individual words
but by phrases, e.g. in this sentence:
<p>
<blockquote>
It makes a difference whether items are sorted according to whether they are
big or small, red or yellow, or fat or thin.
</blockquote>

The last comma (an Oxford comma) helps to make it easier to parse that sentence
and no matter how many style guides or pedants stipulate that it should be
removed, I will go on using it.
<p>
For more on this see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma</a>.
<a href="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutother/oxfordcomma">http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutother/oxfordcomma</a>
which states:
<blockquote>
<small>
"Some people do not realize that the Oxford comma is acceptable, possibly
because they were brought up with the supposed rule (which Fowler would call a
'superstition') about putting punctuation marks before and."
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="cite-papers"></a>
<li>
<b>Do we cite papers or their authors?</b>
<br>
Another example is rigid use of rules regarding 'in' and 'by' in citations. I
found in one of my papers that every time I wrote that a topic had been
discussed or mentioned IN some publication, the copy-editor wanted me to replace
'in' with 'by'. How can something be discussed BY a paper? A paper is not a kind
of agent. Of course, I would say that that something had been discussed BY
Turing in his 1950 paper, but it was discussed IN Turing (1950). I cannot
imagine where that rule came from.
<p>
There are some occasions when you wish to refer not to the paper, but to the
author. For example, Turing (1950) refuted many objections to the possibility of
AI. It was the man, not his paper, that refuted the objections. So we could say
that some researchers did not understand the refutations by Turing (1950). In
these examples we are referring to the person and parenthetically pointing to
the publication in which the work was done. Then it is appropriate to use 'by'.
When we are referring not to the person, but to the publication, it is normally
appropriate to use 'in'. Of course we can talk about the effects of the paper,
and then use 'by', e.g. many readers were misled by Turing (1950) because they
did not read it (NB: 'it', not 'him') carefully.
<p>
Intelligent readers will be able to tell whether you are referring to the paper
or the author(s). It is ridiculous to assume that all references are to authors.
<p>
<b>Note added 4 Mar 2013</b>
<br>
A colleague in another university informs me that one of her colleagues was
pressed by a copy-editor to provide a first name for Aristotle.
<a name="footnotes"></a>
<li>
<b>Footnotes should NOT be at the end of a chapter or paper</b>
<br>
Too many publishers still insist on putting notes at the end of a chapter or
paper. I suspect this is just a relic of the time when it required tiresome
manual labour to get the notes properly formatted at the bottom of a page. There
are now software tools (e.g. Latex) that can do that, so there is no longer any
reason to force readers to keep turning pages back and forth to read some
qualification, or annotation, or to see a reference to further information.
<p>
As a reader I hate being forced to do that, so I do not wish to inflict that
pain on readers of what I write. If a publisher will not allow notes at the
bottom of a page I'll simply rewrite the material so that all the notes are
inline, e.g. using parentheses where appropriate. That will often interrupt the
flow of the text, but no more than being required to go searching for the end of
a chapter or article.
<a name="example"></a>
<li>
<b>Many copy-editors don't understand the diverse uses of "for example"</b>
<br>
There are many blindly followed rules that are fine in some contexts, but not
all, including the rule about inserting commas before and after "for example",
for example, which has often ruined my text and had to be undone.
<p>
It is sensible to put commas before and after "for example" when the phrase is
parenthetical, implying that what has just been mentioned is an example of
something general, as in my previous paragraph. However there is no logic in
inserting a comma after "for example" when it introduces an example, for example
in this sentence, or in cases where "such as" could be substituted, which would
not be used with a following comma, e.g.
<blockquote>
Nasty things can happen as you open a car door in order to get out,
such as a cyclist that you had not seen coming crashing into it.
</blockquote>
<p>
An exception (i.e. a context where a comma is appropriate) is the use of "For
example" to start a new sentence, where the comma marks the real beginning of
the sentence and the "For example" is isolated as a pointer to something
mentioned earlier that is now going to be exemplified. For example, I did that
in one of my sentences about Turing, above, and again in this sentence.
<p>
Following that style rule blindly has the very bad consequence of blurring the
distinction between
<blockquote>
(a) parenthetical uses of 'for example' referring backwards, and
<p>
(b) the more common use referring forwards, i.e. introducing one or more
examples.
</blockquote>
<p>
In the latter case it is as illogical to insert a comma after 'e.g.' or 'for
example' as it would be to insert it after a preposition or relative pronoun
introducing a phrase, or after a verb or participle introducing one or more
objects. For instance:
<p>

<pre>
    'on the table',             NOT 'on, the table'
    'where you were'            NOT 'where, you are'
    'containing eggs and beans' NOT 'containing, eggs and beans'
    'including prime numbers'   NOT 'including, prime numbers'

likewise
    'e.g. apples and pairs'     NOT 'e.g., apples and pairs'
</pre>
<p>
Similar comments can be made about always adding a comma after
'i.e.' or 'that is':

<pre>
    'i.e. leave it out'         NOT 'i.e., leave it out'
</pre>

Many copy-editors seem to have been so brain-washed by the rigid training they have
to go through, or so rigidly instructed by their employers, that they cannot
understand the differences between these uses of the phrase, and so they blindly
insert the unwanted commas all over the place. (I am pleased to acknowledge that
some of them are willing to accept my argument about the illogicality of that
strategy, like the MDPI copy-editor referenced <a href="#MDPI-example">above</a>.)
<p>
An example of the insertion of a comma adding an unwanted ambiguity to my text
is the change from this:
<p>
<pre>
    This is a mixture of good and bad: the good is the description of
    what is going on in a human-like virtual machine, for example during
    certain kinds of perception.
</pre>

to this:
<pre>
    This is a mixture of good and bad: the good is the description of
    what is going on in a human-like virtual machine, for example, during
    certain kinds of perception.
</pre>
Is the example the virtual machine or the process of perception? Leaving out the
second comma makes the answer unambiguous.
<p>
<a name="chapter-paper"></a>
<li>
<b>Why can't a chapter be a paper?</b>
<br>
Another example of misguided pedantry: In my text some of the papers I referred
to happened to have been published in collections in books. In those cases, the
copy-editor wanted me to refer to them as "chapters" rather than as "papers".
That would make sense if the paper really was written as a chapter of a book all
of which was written by the same author or a group of collaborating authors.
<p>
But <i>insisting</i> on my calling them "chapters" rather than "papers" is
arbitrary and unjustified, where either the papers are reprinted in a book,
having been written separately or were written separately for a book by
different authors, who could just as well have published them separately.
<p>
<a name="italics"></a>
<li>
<b>Rules about italics can also be unreasonable.</b>
Oral human communication makes good use of intonation contours, acoustic stress,
and speed changes, along with gestures and facial expressions in some cases.
These devices are not available in written communication, but there are a few
substitutes. In particular, underlining or a change of font can play a useful
role.
<p>
Unfortunately, some puritanical publishers want to ban the use of these devices,
such as using italics for emphasis or other purposes.
<p>
<i>Of course</i> we all know about cases where the use of italics is excessive
and irritating. But there is nothing wrong with <i>occasionally</i> using
italics, for instance to identify points of contrast in a pair of alternatives
(as I have just done) or to make an important principle or slogan stand out,
for instance the principle that <i>copy-editors should aim at minimal intervention</i>,
or something like:
If you don't <i>have to</i> do it then <i>don't</i> do it.

<a name="dates"></a>
<li>
<b>A rule about dates blindly misapplied.</b>
I recently read an article about Williams syndrome children which included a
sentence starting like this:
<pre>
    Despite average IQs in the mid-1950s, adolescents and adults
</pre>
It made no sense to me until I guessed that the author probably
wrote:
<pre>
    Despite average IQs in the mid-50s, adolescents and adults
</pre>
<p>
and some rule-driven copy-editor with no understanding of the content assumed
that was an abbreviated reference to a <i>date</i> rather than an <i>IQ</i> <i>score</i>,
and moronically expanded the date, as dictated by some house rule.
<p>
I don't blame the author for not spotting the error at proof stage: I blame a
system that allows ignorant copy-editors to have a go at messing up academic
papers when they have no understanding of the subject matter, and thereby
wasting huge amounts of time of authors having to pick through all the changes
in order to undo the mistakes -- which can sometimes be hard to spot. Not all
brilliant writers are brilliant proof-readers.

<a name="repetition"></a>
<li>
<b>A rule about repeated words blindly followed (Added 11 Nov 2013)</b>
<br>
I was sent a copy-edited version of an invited paper for AI-Communications where none
of the changes made had been marked. So I had to go through the tedious process
of extracting the text in a format that allowed comparison of the edited version
and the original to to be automated. This revealed errors that I probably would
not have found simply by reading the 'proof'. Two of them were replacements of
'that that' by 'that'. The copy-editor/typesetter had <b>blindly</b> followed a rule
according to which words should not be repeated, obviously failing to
understand:
<pre>
 I knew, from my own experience of learning and doing mathematics,
 that that was false: ...

 ... find it obvious that that must create a list with the original
 elements in the original order
</pre>
<a name="consistency"></a>
<li>
<b>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds (Emerson)</b>
<br>
Consistency is not always important. I understand the logic that leads people to
distinguish 'that' as the word to use in an adjectival clause (There's the cow
that bit me), and 'which' as the word to use when parenthetically adding
information, (There's the cow that bit me, which also happened to be painted
yellow at the time.) When I remember I try to follow that distinction.
<p>
But mostly I forget and in fact the distinction is mostly ignored by writers and
speakers in and out of academe, and actually has no historical justification
according to both <a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Writing/t.html#that">Jack Lynch's web site</a>
and <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/which.html">Paul Brians' web site.</a>
<p>
So please, copy editors, don't waste your time and mine by changing occurrences
of 'which' to 'that'. It risks causing a change in meaning because I really did
intend the 'which' clause to be parenthetical, even if you could not understand
that. Remember: academics write to communicate with people interested in or
working in the field, not to please pedantic copy-editors who don't understand
the text because their interests lie elsewhere.
<p>
<li>
<a name="plurals"></a>
<b>Spurious pluralisation</b>
<br>
In a recent encounter with an over-enthusiastic copy editor I  found that many
of my common nouns were spuriously pluralised, as a result of a failure to
understand the structure of what had been written. (This type of failure is
common among speakers of English, unfortunately. Moreover, I have often made
this mistake in the past in things I have written, though I am now trying to
avoid it.)
<p>
For example, in English, common nouns like "house" and "method" can be used
either to refer to a common *type* or else to categorise *instances* of that
type. In the latter context they are pluralised when there's more than one
instance referred to, e.g. "three houses", "five methods".
<p>
When such words are used in a sentence referring to the type, or category, there
is one type (e.g. "house") but there may be several subtypes. So I can refer to
three types of house: i.e. the (single) type "house" has, among others, three
subtypes, namely bungalow, cottage, semi-detached, etc...
<p>
Unfortunately, the editor has replaced many, but not all, of my singular uses of
a type word in such contexts with plural versions, producing what is strictly
gibberish (though it may be common in sloppy colloquial English). For example,
where I had written:
<pre>
    e.g. types of plant, types of animal, types of reproduction, ...
</pre>
the edited text was changed to
<pre>
    e.g. types of plants, types of animals, types of reproduction,
</pre>
So why not "types of reproductions" ??
That would obviously be wrong, and for the same reason the earlier plurals
are wrong, but not so obviously.
<p>
Another example of this phenomenon:
A well educated biologist describing an organism with six eyes, two facing
forward, two facing sideways, and two facing upwards, with different structures
and different functions would write "The organism has three types of eye, two of
each type" not "The organism has three types of eyes, two of each type".
<br>
[My wife, who taught biology for many years agreed, after pausing to think about
it.]
<p>
Similarly, a hybrid car engine has two types of engine, not two types
of engines.
<p>

<a name="samples"></a>
<li>
<b>Sampling not understood</b>
<br>
Here's another example of a "correction" based on incomprehension.
I wrote:

<pre>
    The reduced search space contains fewer samples from
    the original possibilities,
</pre>
The editor changed this to

<pre>
    The reduced search space contains fewer samples than
    the original possibilities,
</pre>

clearly failing to understand the concept of samples chosen *from* a set.
<p>
This sort of spurious "improvement" occurs all over the place. I can't guarantee
that I'll find and correct them all when proof reading, especially when I am not
given the new version in a format that can be directly compared with my original
text source (usually latex).


<p>
<a name="freedom"></a>
<li>
<b>Towards greater freedom -- let's not go backwards</b>
Whether to use 'toward' or 'towards', and whether to use 'backward' or
'backwards' (as adverb, not adjective) -- that is a question on which at least
one copy-editor has strong feelings. Why, I ask? Another hobgoblin?
<p>
Everyone understands what you mean whether you say 'The bird flew towards its
nest' or 'The bird flew toward its nest'. Why waste my and your time bothering
with changing the text when it makes no real difference? I am glad to see that
<a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Writing/t.html">Jack Lynch agrees</a> as does <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.txt">Paul Brians.</a>
<br>
<a name="bibliography"></a>
<li>
<b>I don't care much about bibliography details</b>
<br>
Perhaps we should allow copy-editors to exercise their tyranny in relation to
punctuation and format of bibliographies, as long as they touch nothing in the
main text without permission. Nobody I know cares about bibliography punctuation
except publishers and they have <i>different</i> preferences, as a result of
which all of us have to waste time (though fortunately some provide latex style
files to do the work for us).
<p>
Production and checking of bibliographies in academic articles wastes far too
much valuable time and effort given how little they are used (especially now
that alternative sources are far more easily available online, and accessing
referenced items typically does not require all the details in the
bibliography).
<p>
When last did you need to know the <i>address</i> of a publisher mentioned in a
journal paper's bibliography???? Requiring people to chase up information that
nobody will ever need is complete idiocy and a waste of our time. Moreover, such
addresses can easily become out of date, since publishers move, or move some of
their activities from one place to another, There are now far quicker and more
reliable ways of gaining information about a publisher than looking at an entry
in a printed bibliography. It's time to abandon the address requirement although
it could remain as an option.

<a name="CUP"></a>
<a name="OUP"></a>
<b>Beware of Oxford University Press</b>
<br>
In 2003 I had a bad copy-editing experience with Oxford University
Press (in the USA), as explained in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/03.html#200305">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/03.html#200305</a>
<p>
I suggest that before you enter into any relationship with them you should make your
conditions and requirements very clear and if they will not agree then take your work
to another publisher.
<p>
It's not just Oxford University Press. One of my colleagues told me that he had
also had dreadful problems with Cambridge University Press copy-editing of a
co-authored book full of highly technical content that was not understood at all
by the copy-editor. There were so many errors and they were so serious that the
authors threatened to withdraw the book unless they were allowed submit their
own camera-ready version produced using Latex. Fortunately their commissioning
editor was intelligent enough to agree, and sales of the book were so successful
that it is now into <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/">its second edition</a>
and has even been
<a href="http://pubs.doc.ic.ac.uk/logic-computer-science-chinese/">translated into Chinese.</a>
Michael Huth, one of the authors, tells me that he has recently had good experiences
with CUP copy-editors, who really understood the technical content of his work.
<p>
So there is some hope.

<b>Note added 23 Aug 2008: MIT Press (Updated: 21 May 2009)</b>
<br>
(This section is under revision and may be out of date: at present it reports
(a) what was on the MIT web site when I last looked, and (b) what I have
experienced as a disgruntled author. It may be changed later, if I find out that
MIT press are more flexible than they have so far appeared to be -- e.g. not
allowing footnotes at the bottom of a page.)
<p>
I've been asked to contribute to a book to be published by MIT press,
and I am now wishing I had not agreed, because of the hassle it has caused me.
<ul>
<li>
The MIT web page for authors is
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/default.asp">here</a>.
<br>
The guidelines for contributors are
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/guidelines/contributors.asp">here.</a>
<br>
The page for editors is
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/guidelines/editors.asp">here.</a>
<br>
It stated (when I was last able to access it):
<blockquote>
"Notes must be gathered at the end of the file; do not place the
notes at the bottom of the page--that is, use endnotes, not
footnotes."
<p>
and also:
"Use your word processor's automatic note inserting and numbering
function, set for endnotes and not footnotes. Place all notes at the
end of the file. In the published book, the notes will appear at the
end of the volume."
</blockquote>
That is one of the requirements I find intolerable, as explained above, and this
is causing problems in connection with the book I was asked to contribute to.
<p>
<li>
They state:
<p>
<blockquote>
"Place periods and commas inside closed quotation marks; place colons and
semicolons outside" another illogical and objectionable requirement, as
explained above.
</blockquote>
<li>
It is clear from the instructions that they expect authors to use WYSIWYG word
processors, instead of using something like Latex, which is far more suitable
for many scientific texts and is positively encouraged by other publishers, who
even provide latex style files. I could not find any mention of latex, though I
have been told that MIT press do accept it. Why don't they advertise the fact?
Instead they merely say
<blockquote>
"The text must be in one of the major word-processing programs for the Mac
or PC, preferably Microsoft Word.
<p>
Do not submit PDFs of your text; send only word-processing files."
</blockquote>
It looks to me as if they have never heard of Unix, Linux, Solaris or LaTeX.
<p>
<li>
A good point is that they submit proofs for checking electronically
<blockquote>
"Your manuscript editor will return the edited manuscript to you as a protected
Word file, along with a style sheet and guidelines for reviewing the editing and
responding to queries."
</blockquote>
A bad point is that they can only do it as a protected Word file. Other publishers
I have dealt with provide proofs in PDF format, which is much more likely to be
platform independent.
<br>
<b>Note added 2016:</b>
<br>
Since OpenOffice/LibreOffice is now available on all the main platforms this is
no longer such a problem.
<p>
<li>
They still insist on following the out of date Chicago Style guide and illogical
placing of punctuation at the end of quoted items.
<p>
<li>
The contributor guidelines state:
<p>
<blockquote>
All elements of the manuscript must be double spaced. This includes the text,
notes, references, block quotations, figure legends, tables, and displays (the
only exception is long tables; these may be single spaced).
</blockquote>
I cannot see any reason for requiring double spacing (which wastes paper, adds
to postage costs, increases the bulk of a document that is being read while
travelling, etc.) -- except out of date procedures that rely on using paper
corrections. This does not seem to square with the above quotation about use of
electronic proofs. Perhaps there is a reason for requiring double spacing that I
have not thought of?
<li>
A most unusual recommendation is to use italics instead of quotation marks for
quoting a word, quaintly expressed as:
<blockquote>
Use italics for words used as words
(as in "it seemed that
<i>possible</i>
was the operative word"); ....
</blockquote>
This flies in the face of well established usage in some academic disciplines.
Why not let academics do things the way they think best?
</ul>
This is all very disappointing (even backward) for serious academic publisher. I
wonder what the academics at MIT press think about it?
<p>
Note added 7 Sep 2008: I am glad to say that I learnt, by writing to
one of the senior people on the editorial list at MIT Press that
they do accept submissions in Latex. It's hard to discover that from
their web site. That suggests that they are not keen on Latex.
<p>
<a name="oup-Edelman"></a>
<b>Note added 7 Sep 2008: OUP again</b>
<blockquote>
Shimon Edelman has just had his book,
    <a href="http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/Cognitive/?view=usa&ci=9780195320671">Computing the Mind</a>
published by OUP.
<p>
They introduced serious errors AFTER the galley proof stage. See
<a href="http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/Computing-the-Mind-corrigenda.html">http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/Computing-the-Mind-corrigenda.html</a>
<br>
However, I believe they allowed him to typeset it all using Latex. I wonder how
many errors there would have been if it had been done the usual way?
<p>
Can any publisher be trusted to do the job properly?
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Elsevier"></a>
<b>Added: 2 Oct 2012; revised Feb 2013: An Elsevier disaster</b>
<blockquote>
I recently had bad experiences with a copy-editor working for Elsevier. I had
<br>
four invited contributions to a compilation they were supposed to publish in
time for the Turing Centenary year.
<p>
I had previously thought that Elsevier's experience of scientific publishing
had taught them the folly of rigidly applying ancient style rules based
on preferences of literary folk a century ago, or more.
<p>
The awful errors they introduced, and the mess they made trying to fix things
later drove the editor of the collection to take charge and re-do everything in
latex (I believe). As a result publication has been delayed by well over a year
and apparently several contributors have wasted many hours of their precious
time on the mess made by Elsevier's copy-editors.

Maybe that's yet another reason to sign up to

<li>
<a name="Springer"></a>
<b>A Springer experience</b>
<br>
I sometimes find that Springer does not mess around with my text, especially
in workshop proceedings. However, in 2016, I received proofs of an invited
chapter for a Springer volume, with some of the faults mentioned above, and many
others, all caused by blindly following rules, and/or failing to understand what
I had written.
<p>
As in so many other cases a lot of changes had been made without being marked,
so I had to set up a file-comparison process to identify them. Some were minor
but annoying, and some irritating new inconsistencies were introduced.
<p>
Example: I had been inconsistent in comma-inserting style. But the copy editing
had deleted some marginally useful commas and some important ones. Moreover, in
some places where I deliberately left out commas they had been inserted. E.g.
compare the discussion of commas after "e.g." <a href="#example">above</a>.
<p>
There were also cases where I had deliberately hyphenated "construction-kit"
to make it easier for people to come across bits of my text using the hyphen in
search engines. They were removed by the editor. But in some places where I
had been inconsistent and there was no hyphen, the editor inserted
a hyphen<b>!!!</b>.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Are copy-editors paid according to the number of changes they make?
</font>
<p>
I know I am not the only academic author who has had to waste many hours finding
and correcting such errors produced by copy editors. Why do publishers go on
allowing this? In part this spurious extra labour is what we are paying for when
journals that should be freely available online because the research they report
is all publicly funded are only available at great cost to teaching and research
institutions.
<p>
People who are writing in a language in which they are not expert should be
encouraged to work together with a copy-editor knowledgeable about the subject
matter,who may or may not be a professional. The result should be a product of
collaboration between author and copy-editor. Ideally help should come from an
expert copy editor recommended by colleagues on the basis of past experience,
rather one that happens to work for the publisher. On this basis an author might
build up a productive working relationship with a particular editor, who is then
used for all the author's work. This could be paid for by departmental funds or
research grants. The cost might be much lower than the cost of all the time
authors have to spend fixing badly edited publications plus the increased costs
of journals. (Many of them have shareholders who get their share of course.)
<p>
<li>
<a name="hand-corrections"></a>
<b>Paper proofs with hand inserted corrections</b>
<br>
[This paragraph is probably out of date now: 2016]
<br>
You should not be presented with a paper version of your manuscript
covered in markings made by the copy editor, through which you have to trawl,
adding your acceptance, rejection or further modification notes: that is far too
time-consuming and error prone. With present-day technology it should be cheaper
and more effective to send an electronic version of the changed text which you
can use software to compare with the original -- a procedure now used by
enlightened and up to date publishers. If the printer has to work from a doubly
edited paper version of your original document then the opportunities for new
errors are far too great, and you will have to waste yet more time checking the
relationships between final page proofs and the paper scrawls. This time-wasting
(and paper wasting) procedure should no longer be necessary in the 21st century.
(Yet some publishers still use it, e.g. Cambridge University Press in 2007, at
least in the USA.)
