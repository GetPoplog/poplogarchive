(These are my personal views and neither the school of computer science
nor the university should be held responsible for them.)

I sense from the ripples in recent email that someone may be trying to
restrict academics to mention nothing in their classes that is not part
of the syllabus.
<P>
This would rule out expressing views about national or international
injustices, bad management of the university, or whatever.
<P>
Such restrictions should be strongly resisted.
<P>
Universities should contain a high percentage of the most intelligent,
thoughtful, independent, creative, and articulate members of the
community, who are committed to the growth and promulgation of knowledge
and understanding. It is part of their traditional role to think,
analyse, find and examine evidence, and expound their conclusions even
when critical of authority -- any authority. If they find evidence that
the earth moves round the sun, or is 4 billion years old, or that humans
are products of evolution, they should say so, no matter who says
otherwise.
<P>
If they reach conclusions that they think are of great importance
(whether to the university, the nation, or the world at large) they have
a positive moral duty to inform their students and other people, whether
or not that happens to be what they are specifically paid to do or
instructed to do by their superiors in the chain of command -- subject
of course to legal or civil action if they break laws (e.g. libel,
incitement to violence, etc.)
<P>
If they do nothing but make such pronouncements, then they can be
penalised for not doing what they are expected to do. But it would be
completely against the function of universities to be sources of
powerful new ideas and challenges to complacency to penalise individuals
for doing *more* than their duty.
<P>
Of course, there is a risk that some cranky staff with bees in their
bonnets will go over the top on their pet hobby-horses, but that's a
price worth paying and the others can articulate their own criticisms of
erroneous views coming from such people.
<P>
Instead of worrying about how such statements might harm the university,
the university should proudly proclaim that one of its principles is to
allow people freedom of speech within the law, even if that occasionally
leads to silliness or causes offence or upset -- because allowing such
independence produces greater long term benefits (e.g. avoiding
stagnation of ideas) than not allowing it.
<P>
If academics in a university meekly accepted that they should do only
what they are instructed to do, I would wish to move somewhere else!
<P>
Some argue that criticising one's own university publicly is a kind of
disloyalty. That's another attempt at excessive control.
<P>
We all accept that it is proper to criticise goverments and government
ministers e.g. on grounds of ignorance, incompetence, bad judgement, or
poor ethics. But at least we also have the chance to vote them out.
Since we don't have the chance to vote out senior managers of
universities it is all the more important that their mistakes should be
pointed out for the greater long term good of the university, the people
in it and the country (or world) that it serves.
<P>
That's a much better kind of loyalty in the long run.
<P>
Anyhow, people who cannot take public criticism should never be involved
in running universities. They should do jobs where their decisions
impact on few others.
<P>
