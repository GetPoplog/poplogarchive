On 25 Feb 2009 The New Scientist published a short article by
Michael Brooks summarising some recent ideas about the relationship
between spatial competences humans share with other animals and the
development of mathematical competences.

"Rise of the robogeeks"

<blockquote>
<small>
<b>
The use of that title, which had absolutely nothing to do with the
content of my work, and the word 'robonerd' used in the printed
version, is typical of the junk produced by modern journalists and
presenters who don't realise that patronising the public is no way
to inform and educate them.
<p>
The article makes a number of completely unjustified assumptions
about what I expect robots with the abilities of human toddlers to
be able to do (e.g. I nowhere suggested that "we're talking about a
machine that could spawn a race of cyber-nerds capable of creating
entirely new forms of mathematics".)
<p>
The actual aim of building a working system (still a long way off)
would be to test a theory by showing that it is capable of
explaining how toddlers learn what they do and how some of them can
develop into mathematicians. Of course, that sort of test would have
to be complemented by empirical research.

On 6th November 2008 The New Scientist published
an interesting article by Lewis Dartnell
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg20026811.700-how-online-games-are-solving-uncomputable-problems.html">
"How online games are solving uncomputable problems"</a> (free only
for subscribers unfortunately) about ways in which human brains (or
minds?) appear to be proving more effective than computers at
solving some hard problems involving spatial manipulation, such as
working out how proteins can fold compactly.
So unlike researchers who attempt to
harness the power of millions of computers on the internet to solve
problems requiring masses of computation, though not necessarily
much intelligence, other researchers are now devising interesting
interactive games and puzzles whose solutions map onto solutions to
hard scientific problems.

New Scientst article</a> (27 October 2006) Tom Simonite reported on
work by Olaf Sporns, Max Lungarella presented in
<a href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~osporns/plcb-02-10-14_Lungarella.pdf">http://mypage.iu.edu/~osporns/plcb-02-10-14_Lungarella.pdf</a>
(in the Journal PLOS Computational Biology, ref
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020144). When he asked for comments,
with about 4 hours notice, I had not read the paper, and did not have
time to do more than a quick skim. It's one of a large and growing
collection of projects attempting to understand the brain in terms of
mappings between inputs and outputs, which I have discussed critically

(commenting on the bad effects of over-emphasis on embodiment in AI
and robotics in the last couple of decades).
<p>
The New scientist article manages to sum up my comments quite well in
a few lines:
<blockquote>
Aaron Sloman, another artificial intelligence researcher, at Birmingham
University in the UK, says interaction with the environment is vital to
intelligence. But he also points out that the human brain is capable of
working with concepts not grounded in the physical world.
<p>
"That is why you can think about a person in Birmingham whom you have
never met," he says, "How does an architect design a new skyscraper,
long before there is anything to see, feel, touch, or manipulate?"

"DO birds consider whether the nest they have built is better than the
one built in the next tree?" asks Aaron Sloman, professor of artificial
intelligence and cognitive science at the University of Birmingham. "I
doubt it." If his assessment is correct, it's a safe bet that you won't
find a bird that feels pride.

Sloman's point is that being proud isn't easy. At the very least you
need a sense of "self" and a way to compare yourself with others. So
feeling superior takes a higher level of mental complexity than most
animals can muster. That doesn't apply to all emotions. The fear that
keeps animals out of the path of a predator or a speeding car, for
instance, is almost universal across species and needs little or no
thought.

But it's the complex emotions like pride that fascinate Sloman. He
believes that they arise naturally from the information-processing ...

<p>
The article starts:
<blockquote>
Researchers working on consciousness could benefit greatly from
incorporating notions of design employed by engineers and software
creators into their work, according to Aaron Sloman of Birmingham
University's school of computer science.
<p>
In a lecture last week at the Royal Society of Arts, Professor
Sloman, a philosopher, advocated a systems approach to
consciousness. He said that much research wrongly uses such words as
"conscious", "aware" and "experience" as if they had clear fixed
meanings and there were clear distinctions between things they apply
to and things they do not apply to.
<p>
 This generates the illusion that consciousness is something that is
either present or absent in an object and tempts researchers to ask
"pseudo- questions" such as which animals have consciousness, how it
evolved, could a robot have it and whether consciousness was
reducible to physics?
<p>
Another tempting mistake is to present consciousness as a matter of
degree as in differences between states of consciousness and
differences between animals.
