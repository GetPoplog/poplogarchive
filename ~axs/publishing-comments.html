Hey mate, I've been doing some digging around recently about various
American and European styles and I stumbled upon your rant about the copy
editors. Let me start by saying that I am working as a copy editor for a
popular techie website, and when I saw the title of your post, I couldn't
be more curious as to why someone would want to rant about people who only
try to improve upon the posts of authors.

Well, after reading the article and having agreed with many of your points
about the various archaic rules of publishing houses all around the world
-- and having followed the American style at my current job -- I couldn't agree
more with the rant. The only points that bothered me, and as one of your
readers pointed out in the comments section, were where you blamed possibly
the entire fleet of copy editors instead of blaming publishing houses who
make people like us follow those rules. For example, I've always been fond
of the age old rule that marks clear distinctions amongst various dashes
and the hyphen, but my publishers feel using that rule is not really
necessary as they were never chided for it by their superiors. It all
depends on how publishers want their posts to look, even if it includes
rules that are no longer relevant in the modern era.

As far as I am concerned, having edited all sorts of posts -- technology,
science, and literature -- in my experience of just over a year, I would
love to have all the posts that come under my supervision to have a
consistency, distinguished only by their content and the "ideal style" that
post should be in, as long as it is not confusing to the reader. Hence, I
feel that while you raise a number of valid points, blaming copy editors
for only following the in-house rules (probably because they need the job
and thus have to follow the guidelines of the publishing house they work
for) instead of blaming the publishers themselves for using archaic rules
dating mid-50s or so, is a bit unfair. Granted my experience is not much to
come to that conclusion and argue with you, but as a reader, editor, and
someone who has been often looked down by people just because I come from
India and thus am considered to lack the "skills of the language", I think
blaming copy editors is not just right when they are under a
near-dictatorial rule by the people they work for.

To: A.Sloman@cs.bham.ac.uk

Hi, I read your rant about copy editors and had to e-mail yourself and
just say what a substantive but equally amusing read it was. As a history
student I was hunting down "publishers insist on end note" via google and
your page came up (I think you can guess my opinions on those!)

Anyway, that was really it, just wanted to say what an enjoyable read it
was start to finish even for one of the MTV generation with an attention
span of 8 seconds, so thanks for putting it up.

I consider many of the comments you have made in this article to be
extremely unfair. Contrary to your opinion, many copyeditors do indeed
understand the points you raise, and indeed, in several instances, could
come up with equally good reasons why some of your 'rules' are incorrect. I
find it strange, therefore, that you feel entitled to dismiss the efforts of
an entire industry, and in particular, those of a large group of
hard-working, generally badly paid, and usually self-employed people who are
doing their best to balance the competing demands of publishers and authors,
without even giving them a chance to reply. In the face of the endless
cost-cutting practised by publishers, their insistence on outsourcing to
overseas contractors (many of whom don't actually speak English) and their
treatment of copyeditors as the lowest form of pond life, most of us are
kept going only by the appreciation of the vast majority of our authors that
we've improved their manuscript and possibly even found some errors they
missed. It's therefore even more depressing when we come across authors like
you, who are sufficiently arrogant to believe that their prose is so perfect
that no-one short of a deity should touch it, that theirs is clearly the
most important manuscript ever to have been submitted to the chosen
publication, and that therefore they are exempt from all of that
publication's requirements, even if lesser mortals have to obey them.
Considering that you're doing your best to destroy livelihoods, then you
should at least have the decency to provide a comments box, so that opposing
points of view can receive equal prominence.

Perhaps you should also consider submitting only to those journals that meet
your exacting requirements? For most journals, the publication requirements
are perfectly clear in the author guidelines, which are usually freely
available online -- if you don't like them, don't submit to that journal.
If,
despite your disdain for these rules, you choose to go ahead, then you
should accept that by doing so, you have given permission for your
manuscript to follow that publisher's style. Don't blame the copyeditor --
they are simply trying to follow the guidelines laid down by their client
(the publisher) and produce the best work that they can. If you are
publishing a book, you may well have the freedom to 'make your conditions
and requirements very clear' -- if you are publishing in a journal, you're
just one of many (sorry to burst your bubble), and to allow each author
impose their own preferences for each paper would make the overall
publication look inconsistent, untidy and amateurish. An academic journal is
not a blog, and fortunately, some publishers still consider quality to be
important, even if it's increasingly under attack.

Dear Mary,

Thanks for your message, which has drawn my attention to aspects of
the situation that I was unaware of.

I would be interested to learn about those reasons. If I am
convinced, I'll change the relevant part of my document, with
acknowledgements.

In the past, when I gave the publishers a chance to reply by
complaining about what they allowed (or asked) copy-editors to do to
my papers, I always got spurious answers, ignoring the points of
substance.

However I would be very happy to attach your message, or a revised
version, if you prefer, to my message. Alternatively if you have a
place where you would prefer to post critical comments on my notes,
I would be happy to add a link on my page.

I am all in favour of open debate on these and other issues. I have
even been known to admit that I am wrong, when I find persuasive
counter-arguments, or factual corrections.

I was not aware of this situation. I am sorry to hear it.

When I posted a message to members of one of the academic
organisations I belong to asking if others had also found their time
wasted by dicatorial and misguided copy-editing I was interested to
find very strong agreement from others. Admittedly that was over
five years ago. Things may have improved since then.

It's not a blog site, and I don't have mechanisms allowing that, but
in view of your comment I shall add a note inviting people to send
me critical comments which I will add, or preferably links to
counterarguments.

Incidentally I do not object to people making suggestions for
improvements to my text, provided that the mechanisms make it easy
for me to find them, and they are sent in electronic format. But I
don't want to waste time undoing changes that have no logic
behind them, only arbitrary stylistic conventions. Life is too
short. (And getting shorter.)

What I have been extremely annoyed by is people sending me printed
proofs of my text without the changes being marked, expecting me to
find the changes that I don't like (which I am not good at doing, so
I have missed garbled things that then got published).

I don't mind getting electronic proofs where the changes are
marked and easily undone.

And you are right: sometimes the suggested changes are improvements.
Unfortunately, in my experience, the majority have been
time-wasting, and ill-informed 'corrections'.

Some of the european journal publishers are now very good at sending
electronic proofs with everything very clearly marked, making it
very easy for me to undo what is wrong, which is an improvement.

> Perhaps you should also consider submitting only to those journals that meet

I have given up submitting things to journals, or collections, and
only write things if invited to. However, even when I say in advance
what my conditions are, people sometimes later on change things in
ways that I find most unpleasant.

You make a good point.I had assumed that copy editors worked
in-house.

I agree that quality is important. That includes giving more weight
to clarity and precision of expression than conforming to rules
compiled a hundred years ago for a different purpose. It also
involves using a document structure with numbered sections, that
allows precise cross-referencing, unlike many academic
publications, unfortuately.

If you think I have misunderstood the point of any of the style
rules or think that my counter examples to the rules are mistaken, I
am always ready to learn, despite my appearance of arrogance (which
is really more annoyance at the amount of time I have had to waste
in the past).

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes.

[and apologies for any typos. I have to rush to a meeting.]
