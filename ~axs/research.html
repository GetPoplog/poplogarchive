Since about 1970 I have been working on philosophy of mind,
philosophy of science, philosophical implications of Artificial
Intelligence, architectures for human minds and other minds,
the architecture of a visual system,
analysis of attention, motivation, emotions and related
affective
states; the uses of computers in education, the design of friendly
programming environments and languages, design of a powerful toolkit to
support exploration of agent architectures.

A book I published in 1978 (<I>The Computer Revolution in Philosophy</I>)
which
set the agenda for much of my
subsequent research has gone out of print, but is freely available
online now:

For about 10 years between about 1981 and 1991, while I was at Sussex
University, I managed the development of
    <a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/adrianh/poplog.html">
    Poplog,
    </a>
a multi-language interactive software development environment.
This included helping to design and implement the
core language Pop11, a Lisp-like language with a syntax more like
Pascal used for teaching and research in AI. It is the basis
of the Sim_agent toolkit, mentioned below. Poplog is now available
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">
free of charge with full system sources.</a>
<P>
Adrian Howard, at Sussex University, has provided
<a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/adrianh/pop11.html">
information on Pop-11.
</a>
<br>
Further information on Poplog and its languages (Pop-11, Prolog,
Common Lisp, Standard ML) is available here:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html</a>

<B>In the last few years I have been working on the following
topics:</B>
<p>
    1. High level requirements for the design of a `complete' autonomous
    intelligent agent (one that has its own desires, and is capable of
    having emotions, attitudes, moodes, etc.), along with partial
    specification of an architecture meeting those requirements. This is
<a href="cogaff.html"> <b>the cognition and affect project.</b> </a>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    I am currently developing (with colleagues) a prototype flexible
    toolkit for exploring a range of experimental agent architectures,
<a href="cog_affect/sim_agent.html"> the SIM_AGENT package.
</a>
    This is being used both for work here (with colleagues and research
    students) and for a project at DERA Malvern on training software for
    novice commanders.
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    2. Analysis of the implications of such architectures for explaining
    high level affective mental states and processes, such as moods and
    emotions. This is part of a more general attempt to understand how
    to think of a mind as an information-based control system. (Several
    papers on this topic are available in
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/cog_affect"> the Cognition
    and Affect directory </a>, and in my
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/misc/"> "miscellaneous
    papers" sub-directory. </a>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    3. Analysis of relations between the concepts of "computation",
    "mechanism" and "representation" and their relevance to explaining
    mental states and processes.
<p>
    This is one of the themes of the IJCAI'01 tutorial on Philosophy and
    AI presented with Matthias Scheutz, described
    <a href="ijcai01/"> here</a>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    4. A high level overview of the purposes of vision, some design
    requirements and constraints, and a sketch of an architecture.
There are several papers on this in the Cogaff directory
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/</a>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    5. As mentioned above, while at Sussex University, I designed and
    implemented some parts of the POPLOG system and managed its
    development.
<pr>
    I still work on it locally at Birmingham. Our extensions
    to the Poplog libraries can be seen in
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">the free poplog directory.</a>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    6. I have been involved in work on requirements for tools for designing
    interfaces, including a collaborative project with Sussex, Integral
    Solutions Ltd and BMT Ltd between 1990 and 1993. This led to a
    number of enhancements of Poplog, including new object oriented and
    graphical facilities.
<br>
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rclib/">My RCLIB package,</a>
    now part of the Free Poplog distribution directory, was partly
    inspired by work on that project.
<p>
<HR>
<P>
    7. I have worked on interactive `student-driven' environments for
    learning and teaching about Cognitive Science and AI, and and have
    been extending this work since coming to Birmingham. This includes
    designing and implementing RHM, the Recursive Hypermenu System, now
    used for starting off new Poplog users at Birmingham. I have also
    produced a large number of "teach" files based on Pop-11, for
    use by beginners and advanced students in finding out about AI and
    programming techniques. Many of these are available online
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/teach">
    in the Birmingham Poplog "teach" directory,
    </a>
    and other directories in the Poplog web site, including
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/primer/">the Pop-11 primer</a>
<br>
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rclib/teach/">the RCLIB teach files</a>

<br>
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/newkit/prb/teach the Poprulebase teach files.

8. I have ideas about `usability' and think that there are many errors
in current designs of interactive computing systems because they
fail to take account of (a) the complex cognitive processes
involved in interacting with a computer (e.g. concept formation,
visual parsing, planning), (b) huge variability between different users
and within the same user over time, (c) the ways in which requirements
can change while a system is in use, (d) differences between the
processes involved in learning to use a new complex system and those
involved in using it when one is a fluent, expert user.
<br>
The same is true of many programming languages designed by mathematical
computer scientists, with no regard for cognitive processes in learners
or users.)

    9. I was, for a while involved in a  project on designing
    methodologies and tools for Risk Assessment and Risk Management, in
    collaboration with Alexander and Alexander. The project manager and
    main project initiator is Sophia Langley
<br>
    This project, RATIFI (pronounced "ratify") was concerned with
    Risk Analysis Techniques in Finance and Insurance. It was funded
    by EPSRC as part of the Safety Critical Systems (SCS) initiative,
    though it is not directly concerned with safety in the conventional
    sense.
<br>
    (Professor Peter Jarratt took over my share of this project in
    December 1994).
