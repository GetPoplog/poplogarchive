More information from Steve Allen regarding production
of portable postscript from Word
<P>
1) Use the File menu to select "Print"
<P>
2) This should bring up a window which allows you to choose
your Printer, define the paper range, number of copies etc.
Next to the printer name is a Properties button (there is an
option button at the bottom of the window - ignore this).
<P>
3) Click the properties button. This will bring up a window
in which you can set the paper size, orientation etc. Each
printer properties will be unique to the printer, but will
have the same type categories displayed as Tabs along the
top of the window (i.e. my HP has Paper, Graphics, Device
Options, and Postscript).
<P>
4) On one of the Tabs you should find a Postscript Option.
Select this. You should now be able to set "Postscript
output format". Normally this says "Postscript (optimize for
speed)", but you can select an "Archive format".
