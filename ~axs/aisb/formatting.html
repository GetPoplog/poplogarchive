SYMPOSIUM: HOW TO DESIGN A FUNCTIONING MIND

<H1><B>
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS
</B></H1>

<hr>
<P>

For each Symposium a separate Pre-Proceedings booklet will be produced,
and will be available at the beginning of the Convention. Accepted
symposium presenters (oral or poster) are expected to produce papers for
the Pre-Proceedings in conformity with the requirements on this page.
We regret that papers which do not conform to requirements may not be
included in the booklet. The formatting requirements are laid down by
the conference organisers and are the same for all symposia.
<P>
Page limits for this symposium:
9 pages for full papers, 2 pages for poster summaries.
<P>

From: Steve Allen, Steve.Allen@dfki.de
<br>
The secret of creating postscript files under Windows for reading on
Unix systems:
<P>
   On the printer options set the format to "Archive".
<P>

<H2><B>Paper Size and Printing Mode</B></H2>
Final versions of papers may be submitted either electronically
(preferred) or in camera-ready hard copy by post. Electronic submissions
must be in PDF or postscript. Use only the fonts mentioned below.
<P>
In either case, the papers must be prepared for printing
on A4 size paper. Hard copy submissions should be printed
on new A4 paper <B>single</B> sided.
<P>
In the event that authors are not able to obtain A4 size paper, they
must submit papers electronically, in postscript or PDF.
<P>
Electronic submissions must be in postscript or PDF <B>ONLY</B> and
must be in a format designed to print on A4 paper.
<P>
If you plan to submit electronically, please send the symposium chair a
sample two page postscript or PDF file in the required format as soon as
possible, so that printing locally can be checked.
<P>
All other formats will be rejected.
<P>
NOTE ON PDF (information kindly supplied by Pat Hayes)
<br>
People have reported problems with PDF files produced by
PDFWriter. Please use Distiller instead. See
<a href="http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a0/about/a1faq.htm#convert">
http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a0/about/a1faq.htm#convert</a>
for details
(under "converting a file to PDF").

<P>
<H2><B>
Online version of the booklet
</B></H2>
It is intended to make all the papers available online. So even if you
do submit your paper in hard copy, it would be helpful if you could
also produce an electronic version to go into the symposium web site.
This could be in PDF, Postscript or HTML, NOT Word.
<P>
<H2><B> Page Layout and Typeface</B></H2>

The printed text should fit within a rectangle of width 17 cm, and
height 24.2cm.
<P>
Aside from the title, authors and abstract, papers should be typeset in
two-column mode, with margins of 2.5cm at the top, 3cm at the bottom,
and 2cm on either side. The inter-column margin should be 1cm.
</p>
<p>
There should be no running page headers or footers.
</p>
<p>
Typeface should be Times Roman, single-spaced, with body text appearing
in 10pt size. For emphasis, please use only italic font, and do not use
bold or underline in the running text. Do not use italic or underline in
titles.
<P>
If you wish to use a different font in diagrams, please use helvetica
only, to prevent problems when printing. Use courier for fixed-width
text (e.g. code examples).
<p>
Three levels of section heading are acceptable: 14pt, 12pt and 10pt. All should
be in bold face. Sections should be numbered in the form N, N.M, N.M.R, for the
three levels, respectively.
<P>

<H2><B> Number of Copies</B></H2>
Authors should submit 2 (two) copies if submitting camera-ready copy.
<P>

<H2><B>Title, Authors and Abstract</B></h2>
<B>Title</B>
should appear at the top of the first page, centred, in 16pt bold text.
<p>
<B>Author's name(s)</B> should be centred, separated by commas, if
appropriate, below the title, in 14pt (not bold), followed by
institution(s) in 12pt (not bold), also centred.
<p>
Email addresses should be given as the final line of the institutional
address.
<p>
<B>The abstract</B> (preferably not more than 250 words) should
be indented on both sides by 0.5, and be set in 9pt type.
<p>
The heading "Abstract" in 10pt bold should be centred one line space above it.
<P>

<H2><B>Figures and Tables</B></H2>
Where possible, figures and tables should appear in the running text, as near
to the first reference to them as possible. They should be numbered
consecutively in Arabic numerals, figures and tables each having their own
distinct numbering.
</P>
<P>Captions for figures should be centred below the figure; captions for tables
should be centred above the table.
<P>

<H2><B>Footnotes</B></H2>
Footnotes should appear at the foot of the column in which they are
referenced. They should be separated from the main text by a horizontal line,
left-justified, spanning more than 0.6 and up to 0.75 of the width of the
column. Point size should be 8 point. Footnote numbers should be sequential,
and in arabic script.
<P>

<H2><B>Page Numbering</B></H2>
Pages should <b>not</b> be numbered. If you submit camera ready copy,
please write the page number lightly, in pencil, on the foot of the
reverse of each page, and also the initials of the main author.
<P>

<H2><B>Acknowledgements</B></h2>
Acknowledgements should be placed in a section headed "Acknowledgements", as a
top level heading, but without a section number, immediately before the
bibliography.
<P>

<H2><B>
References and Bibliography
</B></h2>
References should be given in the APA approved style (most easily available in
LaTeX as natbib). References in running text should appear as "Bloggs (1991)",
and parenthetically as "(Bloggs, 1991)". Multiple parenthetical references
should appear as "(Bloggs, 1992; Doe, 1994)". Please order
multiple references chronologically.
</p>
<p>
The bibliography should appear at the
end of the text, headed "References" as a top level section heading, but
without a section number. Each reference should begin with the surname of the
first author, initials first, and then the other authors in the same order
(<em>i.e.</em> J. Bloggs), separated by commas. Next should come title, then
source (<em>i.e.</em> journal, conference, <em>etc</em>), volume, number, and
pages specified as "V(N):pp-pp", any extra information, publisher, address of
publisher, and finally date.
</P>
<p>
Bibliography entries should be ordered first alphabetically and then
chronologically.
</p>
<P>
