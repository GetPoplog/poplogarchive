SYMPOSIUM OVERVIEW : HOW TO DESIGN A FUNCTIONING MIND
</B></H2>

<a name="background"> </a>
<H3><B>
1. Summary:
</B></H3>
    This two-day symposium will adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to the
    long term problem of designing a human-like mind, whether for the
    scientific purpose of understanding human minds or some engineering
    purpose.
<P>
The invited keynote speakers for the
<a href="http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb00/index.html"> main Convention</a>
are Alan Bundy, Geoffrey Hinton, Marvin Minsky, and Aaron Sloman.
Some of their talks will be relevant to this symposium. Marvin Minsky
and Geoffrey Hinton will also attend this symposium.
<P>

<H3><B>
2. Background to the symposium:
</B></H3>

Much research in AI is fragmented: people work on language, or vision,
or planning, or learning or mathematical reasoning, without necessarily
asking how their models could be combined with others in a fully
functioning mind; or they discuss multi-agent systems where the agents
have only very simple collections of capabilities.
<P>
Much research in
psychology is equally fragmented: investigating particular capabilities
and how they are affected by environmental factors, or brain damage, or
gender, or age, etc.; for instance linguistic or visual or problem
solving or memory or motor control capabilities.
<P>
Moreover such research
often produces interesting empirical results without leading to a theory
that is deep or precise enough to be the basis for a design for a
working system.
<P>
Some philosophers also think about these topics and
attempt to analyse the concepts involved in talking about minds, or
necessary or sufficient conditions for various kinds of mentality, but
without doing so at a level that might guide an engineer attempting to
design a mind: and some of them produce arguments claiming to show that
the task is impossible, but without formulating the arguments in a
manner that could convince a computer engineer.
<P>
Ethologists study the
minds of many kinds of animals and how they differ, but often without
asking what sorts of architectural differences might underly the
observed differences in behavioural capabilities, social structure, etc.
<P>
Biologists and paleontologists study the evolution of systems which
include humans and other animals but generally find it much easier to
investigate the development of physical form and physical capabilities
than the mechanisms of mind.


<P>
<H3><B>
3. The purpose of the symposium
</B></H3>
<br>

The symposium is intended to bring together people interested in
building bridges between various kinds of partial studies, with the long
term goal of understanding, at least in principle, how to build a
complete mind.
<P>
Researchers in any discipline are invited to submit posters which address
these issues, whether in a speculative fashion or by reporting firm
results which directly contribute to the long term task. Examples of
topics might be proposed include: architectures to accommodate multiple
aspects of human mental functioning, or analyses of requirements for
such architectures, or a critique of existing architectures on the basis
of their functional limitations or inconsistent empirical evidence, or
discussions of how important aspects of human minds might have evolved,
or analysis of the problems of designing an adult mind vs designing an
infant mind which develops into an adult mind, or comparisons between
capabilities of different animals which provide evidence for
architectural differences, or overviews of major results in neuroscience
which have implications for the virtual machine architecture of a mind
(e.g. evidence from brain-damaged patients indicating what sorts of
separable functional modules exist).
<P>
Philosophical posters presenting familiar arguments to prove that the
task is impossible are not particularly welcome whereas philosophical
arguments which highlight some of the difficulties to be overcome are.
<P>

<B>
DRAFT SYMPOSIUM SCHEDULE NOW AVAILABLE
</B>
</a>
<P>
The symposium will consist of four main half-day sessions followed by a
concluding session. Each of the four main sessions will be composed of a
set of half hour presentations of selected papers followed by a half
hour (or longer) discussion period led by a member of the organising
committee. There will also be sessions for poster presentations. The
talk by David Lodge, will be on the first afternoon.
<P>
The final session of the symposium (Tuesday afternoon) will be a
discussion session aiming to identify achievements of the symposium and
important unsolved problems which are worth addressing in the near
future. It may be useful also to discuss future events of the same kind.
<P>
There will be poster presentation sessions organised concurrently
for the whole AISB Convention, bringing members of the different
symposia together.
