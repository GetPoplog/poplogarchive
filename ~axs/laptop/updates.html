It is part of
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop">this web site</a>
reporting my experiences with linux and
software suspend (SWSUSP) on a Dell Latitude D600 notebook/laptop
computer.

UPDATE 27 Jun 2004 (Problems mentioned here now fixed)
</B></H3>
I find that after suspend+resume I am sometimes forced to kill X
if I had displayed movies or a dvd (using gxine or gmplayer) before
suspending. (Not always, only sometimes.)
<BR>
<B> NB The problems listed in this section appear to have disappeared
since I installed version 4.4 of XFree86</B>

<blockquote>
<B> Previous symptoms, apparently now cured</B>

<LI>
If I suspend after displaying a video file, then sometimes playing
a video file shows no picture, though sound is fine. Restarting X
without rebooting fixes that however. It does not always
happen after resume, and I can't see what the pattern is.
<LI>
Sometimes after resume, the X display is badly corrupted and I cannot
kill X, so I have to reboot. Also if I go to a login console (CTRL+ALT
F2) the screen is completely black.
<B>
This seems to be a consequence of resuming with the lid shut.
</B>
When that happens I can log in remotely, and top shows X using up 99% of
the cpu. However if I try to kill the X process everything freezes and I
have to use the power key to switch off (hold it down for several
seconds). This does not happen if I boot without having suspended, and
leave the lid down.
<BR>
So my happy report (below) on software suspend working after upgrading
to 2.4.26 was premature. It MOSTLY works, and works perfectly if I don't
display videos and don't resume with the lid down!

UPDATE 18 Jun 2004
</B></H3>
Had to remove radeon patches from Volker Braun's site mentioned in the
main web page: they apparently cause xine and mplayer to crash X.
<br>
So I am back to incomplete screenblank (later fixed
in X11 version 4.4, as
described
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/">on main web page</a>).

UPDATE 13 Jun 2004
</B></H3>
It is now working with a 2.4.26 Kernel with the CPUFREQ and SWSUSP
patches added. Almost everything seems fine. Details
in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop">the main file</a>.
