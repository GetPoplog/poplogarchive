<b>NEWS 23 Mar 2017: Using Moto G version 3 smartphone as an access point</b>
<br/>
I resisted buying a smart phone for many years -- eventually persuaded by
colleagues that I was missing useful functionality in May 2016. Settled on Moto
G3 on grounds of cost, functionality, reviews and a personal recommendation. I
made the mistake of buying the 8GB model (unlocked, without sim, from John
Lewis), not realising that adding extra SD memory is not analogous to adding an
extra hard drive on linux or windows. I acquired a PAYG sim from EE who
transferred my old mobile phone number (Orange) to the Sim.
<p>
For a while I had some problems with 64GB SD card, but later installed a 32GB
faster SD card and that has worked perfectly.
<p>
This has made my T-mobile, and Three mifi devices redundant, because it works
well on 3G 4G connections and can act as a wifi hot spot. I've used it on trains
and at conferences where eduroam was not available.
<p>
I mostly use it with wifi at home or on campus so don't need the 4G service
much, but when I do, e.g. when travelling, I find the &pound;1.00(GBP) PAYG
Data Packs quite convenient: each lasts for 7 days and allows up to 100MB
data and plus some minutes of phone calls and several texts -- and I hardly ever
need it as a phone. A heavy user of phone, text and mobile wifi might find a
more economical solution.
<p>
This mostly gives me better value than the Three Mifi device, as the minimum
PAYG purchase from Three lasts only one day and costs a lot more, though it does
include more data, which I don't normally need within a day.

<b>NEWS 7 Mar 2012: Three Huawei E586 Mifi device</b>
<br/>
Partly because tmobile mobile broadband does not support Skype, I
started enquiring about alternatives, and ended up, after much
consultation and dither, with the Three Mifi device.
<p>
Someone wrote, in answer to my request for advice

</pre>
</small>
<p>
After doing more research, and since I shall be doing more
travelling than usual in the near future, I decided to try the
latest version of this, the E586, available only from three at
present (as far as I can tell).
<p>
<a href="http://store.three.co.uk/Mobile_Broadband/MiFi">http://store.three.co.uk/Mobile_Broadband/MiFi</a>
<p>
Sample review here (on dreadful website full of stupid moving
adverts on both sides of text):
<br/>
<a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/modem-routers/huawei-mifi-e586-1005060/review">http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/modem-routers/huawei-mifi-e586-1005060/review</a>
<br/>
(I must replace that review link with one that's less annoying.)
<p>
There are different price plans, and for someone in my position, not
using the device except when travelling (which is why I used Pay As You
Go for t-mobile -- which rules out use of skype), it turns out cheapest
to go for a monthly contract, cancelled after one month, followed by
purchase of sims as needed:

<small>
<pre>
    MiFi 5GB per month
    Price details. £15.99 a month for 5GB per month
    49.99 upfront cost for device.
    minimal contract 1 month.
</pre>
</small>

So initial purchase, including 1 month+5GB, costs £66 (or a bit more
if you start using the device before the official start date of the
<p>
contract).
<p>
[Starting then cancelling this was recommended by the person in the
Three shop.]
<p>
You can cancel the contract with 1 month notice, and after that go
for one of the cheaper 12 month 12GB three sims available on
Ebay/Amazon.
<p>
I can report that the device is much simpler to use than a typical
mobile broadband dongle. When switched on it makes its own
connection and then provides a normal wireless router (wpa) service:
so I used wicd to connect using the essid and password that comes
with the sim.
<p>
You can then access the device in a browser, using 192.168.1.1 (I
don't know if that can be changed), and get information about the
connection, current usage total, and also a useful text-messaging
interface in the browser (tested by sending messages to and from my
orange mobile phone). Since all of that is operating system
independent it works out of the box on linux. It supports up to 5
connected devices.
<p>
Upstairs in my house download speeds were slightly better than
tmobile, but very variable -- between about 600 and 1600 kb/s
(mostly at the lower end), upload speeds faster: consistently
between 1000 and 1500 kb/s.
<p>
Wireless signal strength enabled connection from first floor to
hallway and rooms below, but using repeated pings to the device
indicated that level dropped faster than when using my normal router
Dlink DIR 615.
<p>
I don't know what would happen in trains, hotels, etc. if lots of
people started using these devices -- would they interfere with one
another?
<p>
I suspect our computer officers would not allow such devices to be
used in our department.
<p>
Battery can be charged either via Usb socket or wall charger
(includes a usb socket). I don't know how often I'll forget to
switch off the device after use and drain the battery. The battery
is replaceable, so I suppose that in principle one could have a
spare.
<p>
If bought in shop you need a debit card for credit check.

Tmobile now have new options for travellers. If you try to connect in
France, Germany and some other countries you have to run a browser and
will get pre-pay options for various time-periods. If you are a
'PayAsYouGo (PAYG) customer the cost of the chosen optoin is deducted
from your current balance.

<blockquote>
Commands for sending text messages and interrogating the system from
a text editor (the poplog editor Ved) are available. These commands
are not required for using the USB stick to connect to the internet.
They provide additional functionality, especially sending and
reading text messages via the USB stick (assuming it is already
connected as described below).
<p>
The commands
are implemented in Pop-11, the core language of Poplog, but it
should be possible for users of other programming languages to copy

<b>NEWS 1 Jan 2010</b>
<blockquote>
    <b>WARNING 1:</b>
    <br/>
    The t-mobile service has an under-18 lock which is turned on by default
    to prevent access to 'social networks'. This even blocks google mail and
    signing in to a google account, though not yahoo mail.
    Blocking google mail, which so many people use now, is stupid and arbitrary
    (especially when they have the information that I am over 70).
    <p>
    The web site says you can remove the block interactively,
    but that works only for phone users not mobile broadband users. I have
    complained. Others should too!
    <p>
    After they removed the block I could access google mail when running the
    t-mobile software on windows, but not when using linux. I don't know why.
    It just hangs, with no explanation.
    <br/>
    <b>T-mobile need to fix their service.</b>
<br/>
    NOTE: some time after I wrote that (and complained to t-mobile)
the fault disappeared and I can now connect to google mail, google
groups. etc.
    <p>
    <b>WARNING 2:</b>
    <br/>
    I tried the linux mechanisms below with a newer t-mobile mobile
broadband usb stick (model 150) bought for someone to use in
hospital (3 months Mobile Broadband plus usb stick for
&pound;44.03). This has the Huawei E1630 device (according to the
label on the stick)
<p>
It worked on windows, though only with its own
web'n'walk manager, not the older one.
However, when I tried it on
linux it did not work. I don't know why.
It does not switch to modem mode, although the device is recognised.
<pre>
    lsusb
</pre>
produces (among other things)
<pre>
    Bus 001 Device 010: ID 12d1:1446 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
</pre>
I tried running usb_modeswitch (using -W for 'verbose' output):
<pre>
    usb_modeswitch -H -p 1446 -v 12d1 -W
</pre>
It recognised the device but could not connect it as a modem.

<b>NEWS 25 Oct 2009: Use on the continent works</b>
<blockquote>
I wrote to t-mobile support (via their web site) and mentioned that
I could not find any information on how to use my pay-as-you go
t-mobile web-n-walk stick to access the internet outside the UK.
<p>
In response I got this:
<small>
<pre>
   I'm pleased to hear that you're happy with the help we gave you. We
   appreciate hearing comments like these and will keep working hard to
   continue this high level of service.

   I've activated the roaming service on your account, you'll now be
   able to use your USB stick in Germany.

   You'll be charged at international roaming rates for accessing
   internet whilst abroad.

   Accessing internet is charged &pound;1.50 (including VAT) per Mb in EU
   countries and &pound;7.50 (including VAT) per Mb in rest of the world. To
   see the list of our eligible EU countries click <a href="http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/services/going-abroad/using-the-internet-abroad/">here.</a>
</pre>
</small>
I have now tried this on my t-mobile usb stick using my Dell Latitude
D610.
<ul>
<li>
In Germany it worked both on linux (using wvdial to connect, as
described below, on Fedora 10) and on Windows XP using the t-mobile
software.
<li>
The first time I tried it in France (in Paris), I could not get it
to work on linux but it did connect using the t-mobile software.
Later I tried again using linux and it worked.
</ul>
<p>
I have found this service useful, but I wish T-Mobile would explain
more clearly on their web site how a mobile-broadband pay-as-you go
customer can set up the foreign service. I found nothing about this
until I wrote to customer support.
<p>
Since I mostly read and send mail by logging through to our
departmental network using ssh, and running pine, the amount of data
transmitted in a couple of hours of use can be very low. On one
journey in Germany I was connected on the train for about 2 hours
and it cost me less than #0.50p. On a later date I was connected for
longer and transmitted several files as well as reading mail. The
cost over about 2.5 hours was about #1.15
However, I have found that it is too easy to go over 1MB if I use
a web browser, or if I transfer files, so it can be expensive,
though very convenient for reading email on a train, via
ssh and pine.
<br/>
(I don't often find that it works on UK trains: it depends on the
route. It did not work on most of the Virgin line between Euston and
Birmingham when I last tried, but it work well on the slower route
from Marylebone to Birmingham.)
<p>
I think the service is getting better. When I first tried it in my
study at home and for several months after, the connection never got
above a few hundred Kbits/sec, whereas I have recently (December
2009) found the speed going up to nearer a Mbit/sec.)
<p>
For pay-as-you-go users, it is necessary to top-up in advance and
make sure your balance is adequate for your likely use abroad.

<h3><b>
Using T-mobile web-n-walk Mobile Broadband USB stick
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
In October 2008 I bought a
<a href="http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/mobile-broadband/">T-Mobile web-n-walk mobile broadband USB stick</a>
which identifies itself as Huawei E220/E270, though it is
labelled Huawei Model E160 HSDPA USB Stick. I bought this for
occasional use while travelling in the UK, or waiting at airports,
since not all hotels provide wifi services and many of those that do
charge a lot of money, as do airports, whereas T-Mobile has a flat
rate charge of only &pound;2 for a day's use. That's high for
regular use, but low for intermittent use.
<p>
<b>Update 1 Jan 2010:</b>
<br/>
They now have three pay-as-you-go options:
<pre>
    &pound;2 a day, &pound;7 a week or &pound;15 a month
</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="prelim1"></a>
<h3><b>
Use on Linux - part 1 (using usb_modeswitch -- if necessary)
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
It seems that all recent versions of linux come with kernel support
for these Huawei broadband devices, though some users find that
because these sticks can function either as a USB memory device or
as a wireless modem, some linux systems mount them as memory
devices, and switching them into modem operation requires use of a
utility usb_modeswitch, which may have to be installed. It is
described
<a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/">here.</a>
<p>
I found that with Fedora 8 and Fedora 10, both running recent
kernels, I did not need to use usb_modeswitch. Instead, after
plugging the device in I waited some seconds and then found, using
'lsusb' that it had been recognized as follows:
<pre>
   Bus 001 Device 004: ID 12d1:1003 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E220 HSDPA Modem / E270 HSDPA/HSUPA Modem
</pre>
That output is an indication that usb_modeswitch has done its job.
</blockquote>
<a name="prelim2"></a>
<h3><b>
Use on Linux - part 2 After the wireless device is recognized
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Once the device has been recognized it can be used in one of two
modes, namely either for connecting to a broadband transmitter,
allowing normal internet access, or a text mode for sending SMS text
messages.
<p>
If used with either Windows or Apple Mac the software supplied on
the device is automatically installed and runs a graphical interface
for connecting, switching modes, fetching or receiving text
messages.
<p>
On linux there is no manufacturer supplied software for this
purpose, though some users have found that NetworkManager recognises
and supports the device (though I understand some users have had
problems using NM with it), and as explained below there is a
graphical software package (VMC) developed for use on linux with
Vodafone mobile broadband sticks containing the same Huawei chip. It
can also be made to work with the T-Mobile stick.
<p>
However if you are prepared to use the command line, no such
graphical tool is needed: I found that the 'wvdial' command can be
made to work after setting up a configuration file, as explained
below.
<p>
A problem with wvdial as used in this context is that instead of
locating the file resolv.conf, with DNS addresses in
/etc/resolv.conf it puts the file in /var/run/ppp/resolv.conf
<p>
In consequence my script to run wvdial does

<pre>
    rm -f /etc/resolv.conf

    ln -s /var/run/ppp/resolv.conf /etc
</pre>

also, before it shuts down it does

<pre>
    rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
</pre>

so that other wireless services can place information there.
<p>
<b>Files to download</b>

<blockquote>
My (once and maybe still current)
version of /etc/wvdial.conf is <a href="huawei/wvdial.conf">here.</a>
<blockquote>
I am not sure it is all necessary. Also it needs to be changed when
travelling abroad.
<p>
For your system you may be able to discover the
required parameters by running the device on windows, and then
displaying and saving its current settings.)

<p>
My script (as of July 2011) for starting up the mobile broadband
connection is
<a href="huawei/nethuawei">here</a>.
<br/>
Don't forget to make it executable after editing (chmod 755
filename)
</blockquote>
<p>
The rest of this document explains how to download, set up
and use the Vodafone vodafone-mobile-connect (VMC) graphical tool on
Fedora 10, and how to use the command line interface if you prefer
that.

<h3><b>
Use on Linux - using VMC (Vodafone Mobile Connect)
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
The package can be downloaded from this web site
<a href="https://forge.betavine.net/frs/?group_id=12">https://forge.betavine.net/frs/?group_id=12</a>
<p>
I fetched this version, listed under 'Fedora' on the above web site:
<br/>
<a href="https://forge.betavine.net/frs/download.php/543/vodafone-mobile-connect-svn20090615.noarch.rpm">https://forge.betavine.net/frs/download.php/543/vodafone-mobile-connect-svn20090615.noarch.rpm</a>
<p>
My attempt to use 'rpm -ivh' to install the package produced this
complaint:
<small>
<pre>
    pyserial is needed by vodafone-mobile-connect-2.10.01-1.noarch
    python-twisted is needed by vodafone-mobile-connect-2.10.01-1.noarch
    pytz is needed by vodafone-mobile-connect-2.10.01-1.noarch
    usb_modeswitch >= 0.9.7 is needed by vodafone-mobile-connect-2.10.01-1.noarch
</pre>
</small>
However 'yum' was able to fetch and install all those, updating some
other packages in the process. The total download required was
about 4.9MB.
<p>
After that I used 'rpm' to install the vodafone package -- this
version: <pre>
    vodafone-mobile-connect-2.10.01-521.noarch
</pre>
<b>WARNING:</b> I tried installing a later version, but it would not
work on my machine: it gave error messages at startup.
<p>
I was able to run it logged in as root, or using 'sudo':
<pre>
    sudo vodafone-mobile-connect-card-driver-for-linux
</pre>
Even with use of TAB for file-name completion that's  a tedious
command, so I made the abbreviated name 'vmc' a symbolic link to:
<pre>
    /usr/bin/vodafone-mobile-connect-card-driver-for-linux
</pre>
There is a variant of the command with suffix 'debug' which can used
to get a lot of debug output.
<p>
When I gave the vmc command it instantly recognized the Huawei device
and made it easy to send or receive SMS text messages. However I
could not switch it into broadband mode by clicking on the
'Connect' button.
<p>
It turned out that to enable that to work I had to edit this
configuration file (template file):
<pre>
    /usr/share/vodafone-mobile-connect/resources/templates/wvdial.conf.tpl
</pre>
Since I had previously got the T-mobile stick to work using wvdial I
copied relevant bits of <pre>/etc/wvdial.conf</pre> into the
template file, producing this:
<pre>
    [Dialer Defaults]

    Phone = *99#
    Username = web
    Password = web
    Stupid Mode = 1
    Dial Command = ATDT
    Check Def Route = on
    Auto DNS = $autodns
    Dial Attempts = 3

    [Dialer connect]

    Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
    Baud = 460800
    Init1 = ATZ
    Init2 = ATZ
    Init3 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
    Init4 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP" "T-Mobile"
    ISDN = 0
    Modem Type = Analog Modem
</pre>
At that point I had a directory ~/.vmc2 which had been created
during my previous experiments, so I deleted that and once again
tried the command. The graphical panel started up as  before, and I
created a new profile using the menu command:
<pre>
    Using --> tools --> profile --> New
</pre>

I called the profile tmobile, with username and password 'web'
selected '3G preferred' for the connection mode, 'Default' for
authentication, and T-Mobile for APN host (the last was just a guess: it
required me to insert something, but I don't know whether it used the
information, since wvdial did not need it).
<p>
Later I found that I could save the profile from the Web'n'walk
manager provided by t-mobile for Windows, and that gave me the
following:
<pre>
    username = t-mobile
    dns2 =
    dns1 =
    staticdns = no
    dialer_profile = PAP
    phone = *99***1#
    connection = 3GPREF
    apn = T-Mobile
    password = tm
</pre>

After all that, starting up the package produced this display
(though with my message 'Inbox' showing, which I have hidden by
clicking on 'Draft'):
<p>
<img alt="vmc display" height="350"  src="vmc-running-huawei.png"/>
<p>
The 'inbox' tab shows messages received. Clicking on 'New' allows a
new message to be composed and sent.
<p>
Clicking on 'Connect' switches the connection from text-mail mode to
internet mode, allowing web browsing, sending and receiving email,
remote logins, etc., using the device named 'ppp0' as the interface
to the modem.
<p>
Clicking on 'Mail' invokes your default internet email tool, e.g.
thunderbird. The 'Quit' button is under 'File'.
<p>
Clicking on 'Inbox' shows current text messages not yet deleted.
<p>
At the bottom is a handy little signal strength meter: at my home it
was mostly on the smallest bar, though occasionally the second bar
changed colour too. Despite that low signal level I was able to get
internet files, and even play a BBC news video, with occasional
pauses. (The speed seems to have increased considerably since I
wrote that.)
<p>
Clicking on 'Usage' gives useful information about amounts
downloaded and uploaded in the current session and the current
month.
<p>
I have read in one of the forums that it may sometimes be better to
switch the profile from '3G Preferred' to 'GPRS Preferred' when the
signal strength is low. I have not yet experimented with that.

<h3><b>

<blockquote>
Before I got the 'vmc' command working I used 'wvdial' as follows.
<p>
I created a file /etc/wvdial.conf containing this, based on
information obtained on the internet.
<pre>
    [Dialer Defaults]
    Init1 = ATZ
    Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0

    Password = web
    Baud = 460800
</pre>
WARNING: keep a backup version of that file, as it can be changed,
e.g. if you run the 'wvdialconf' program.
<p>
To switch from my normal wireless configuration to using the USB
stick, I wrote a shell script that shuts down other network
interfaces 'ifdown eth1' 'ifdown eth0', turns off the wpa_supplicant
service, saves a copy of the file /etc/resolv.conf and replaced it
with a symbolic link to
<pre>/var/run/ppp/resolv.conf </pre>
<pre>
    ln -s /var/run/ppp/resolv.conf /etc
</pre>
Finally this command sets up and runs the connection:
<pre>
    wvdial tmobile

That causes something like the following text to be printed out
when the connection is made successfully:

Where the reception is poor it can disconnect itself, but in some
places, e.g. airports, I found the connection very good, even though
it was never very fast.

The only way to terminate the session launched by running wvdial
seems to be to kill the wvdial process by typing 'Ctrl C' into the
window. After that, it may be necessary to reinstate the saved
version of /etc/resolv.conf (as my home-grown script does).
<p>
Before trying to run a broadband connection using the Huawei
device remember first to shut down any alternative network
interfaces, for everyone's sanity.
