LAST UPDATE: 3 Aug 2010 (Now three battery makers)
</small>
</small>
</b></h3>
At the end of May, I ordered a Dell Latitude E6410 with two
9 Cell Batteries. I received the laptop and two batteries on 4th
June. Both batteries were labelled as having 90Whr capacity. One was
made by Samsung, and one by Simplo, as revealed by the linux
command:
<pre>
    cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
</pre>
<p>
On 1st July I reported to Dell Support that the Simplo battery
appeared to have a fault insofar as its performance was
significantly different from the Samsung's.
If the charger was connected when the battery was not fully
charged it did not always start recharging: the charge level had to
drop to around 95% before recharging was possible. It also did not
last as long without AC power as the Samsung battery.
<p>
<b>The Simplo battery was replaced on 14th July: another Simplo
battery was delivered and the old one collected</b>
<p>
Unfortunately, testing showed that the replacement battery had the
same charging fault as the original (and that it was also made by
Simplo).
<p>
I charged the battery fully and found that it could keep the E6410
going for 6 hours 18 minutes while running with a very low CPU load,
screen brightness on minimum, and wireless on but not used much,
before the charge level dropped to about 7% with the warning light
flashing. In contrast the Samsung lasted 7 hours 34 minutes before
dropping to 7%.
<p>
I reported the charging fault and the discrepancy in capacity. I was
then promised another replacement, which was to be a Dell Battery
made by Samsung. A new battery was delivered on 22nd July, but
turned out to be another Simplo, with the same charging fault as
before, i.e. not recharging if the charge level had dropped only a
few percent from full charge when the charger was connected. So I
reported this. However when I tested its endurance I found it better
than the previous Simplo, though not as good as the Samsung (as
shown on the graph below).
<p>
I was then promised yet another replacement, which was at first
going to be another Samsung-made battery. However, for some reason
they decided to send me a battery made by Sanyo, delivered (after
some confusion about dates) on 29th July. It turned out to have the
same fault as the Simplo: if the charge level has not dropped below
about 96% it cannot be recharged to 100%. When I gave it the
endurance test it did not do as well as the Simplo that had been
delivered on 29th July, though it was much better than the Simplo
delivered on 14th July.
<p>
Right now (2 Aug 2010) I have three batteries: the Samsung ordered
and delivered with the laptop on 4th June, the replacement Simplo
battery delivered on 22nd July and the replacement Sanyo delivered
on 29th July. Only the Samsung does not have the charging fault.
<p>
I have also tested all three batteries
to see how long they last under light load. The results are
summarised <a href="three-batteries.pdf">in this pdf file,</a> and also shown
in the graph below.

<h3><b>
<b>Getting information about batteries:</b>
</b></h3>
On linux (Fedora 13) the command
<pre>
    cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
</pre>
displays mostly static information about the batteries, as follows.

<h3><b>
Results of command: 'cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state'
</b></h3>
This command can be used to get information about the current state
of the battery, both when it is charging and when it is discharging.
<p>
For example when the charger is connected and the battery is fully
charged this sort of information is shown:
<pre>
    present:                 yes
    capacity state:          ok
    charging state:          charged
    present rate:            1 mA
    remaining capacity:      8400 mAh
    present voltage:         12793 mV
</pre>
Sometimes the above is also displayed, on the Simplo and the Sanyo,
when the battery is not fully charged, and nevertheless is not
charging.
<p>
After the AC power plug is removed, it can change to something like
this:
<pre>
    present:                 yes
    capacity state:          ok
    charging state:          discharging
    present rate:            1470 mA
    remaining capacity:      8400 mAh
    present voltage:         12645 mV
</pre>

When charging, the information looks like this:

<pre>
    present:                 yes
    capacity state:          ok
    charging state:          charging
    present rate:            724 mA
    remaining capacity:      7833 mAh
    present voltage:         12586 mV
</pre>


<h3><b>
Comparing usable times with the three batteries, when fully charged.
</b></h3>
I charged each battery fully, then removed the plug, and used a
program to record the values every two minutes for
<pre>
    remaining capacity:
    present voltage:
</pre>

The computer was not doing much. It was running a lightweight window
manager, with a few xterm windows open, a clock and for a short
proportion of the time firefox with a few web sites displayed.
During the test I kept the brightness level as low as possible.
<p>
Wireless was connected and I used the connection
both to log through to a departmental machine at the university, and
also to log through from my desktop machine to the laptop
occasionally.
<p>
I let the batteries run down until they were registering about 7% of
maximum charge.
<p>
<b>Results of endurance test</b>
<br/>
These are the times taken to drop to about 7% of maximum charge:

<blockquote>
<b>Samsung Battery (delivered 4th June, tested on 15th July,
after significant use)</b>
<pre>
    Total survival time: 454 mins  = 7 hours 34 mins
</pre>
<b>Simplo Battery (delivered 15th July, tested on 31st July, having
been used a few times)</b>
<pre>
    Total survival time: 436 mins = 7 hours 16 minutes
</pre>
<b>Sanyo Battery (delivered 29th July, tested 31st July,
hardly used at all)</b>
<pre>
    Total survival time: 410 mins = 6 hours 50 minutes
</pre>
</blockquote>
The following graph shows the rates of decay and lifetimes running
without charger in a more useful way:
<p>
<img alt="Three batteries" src="three-batteries.jpg"/>
<p>
The bottom graph is for the Sanyo, the middle one for the Simplo,
and the top one for the Samsung. The Sanyo and Simplo were both very
new at the time of the test, whereas the Samsung had been used
intermittently between 4th June and the test date 15th July.

<p>
X values (horizontal axis) are minutes since the beginning of the
test.
<p>
The Y values (vertical axis)  were the result of multiplying
"remaining capacity" and "present voltage" measures and dividing by 1000000 then rounding.
<p>
The graphs indicate two sorts of difference between the batteries
<ul>
<li>
Capacity when fully charged (indicated by maximum value on curve at
beginning of graph)
<li>
Rate of decay while in use (indicated by steepness of slope of the
curve).
</ul>
Of course I cannot guarantee that the loads
were exactly similar: I was running linux in both cases, but doing
very little work on the machine though it was connected to my
wireless network. Linux can run various programs automatically at
certain times of the day, but I did not attempt to disable that.
<p>
However, there are clear differences in maximum charge levels that
would not depend on the test conditions (but will change with age
and usage of the battery). There also seem to be slight differences
in the rate at which charge is lost during the test, with the Sanyo
decaying slightly faster than the other two, in addition to having
the lowest maximum charge. Of course, this was a very small sample,
and I have no way of knowing whether there are random differences
between batteries of the same sort.
<p>
The one factor that is clearly based on design seems to be the
inability of the Simplo (both batteries tested) and Sanyo batteries
to accept any charge when they they are are still about 96% charged
after having been fully charged and then used for some time. They
cannot be recharged fully until after the charge level has dropped
further (e.g. about 95% or lower). The Samsung battery does not have
this fault.
<p>
<b>Graph-drawing program</b>
<br/>
The Pop-11
graph drawing program
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/rclib/graphplot/">(rc_graphplot)</a>
was used to draw the graphs.

<p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br/>
On the basis of my experience, the Samsung battery is clearly
superior to the other two, though of course I cannot tell whether it
would be better over its lifetime.
<p>
The Sanyo battery is much better than the Simplo battery sent on
14th July (not shown on the graph), but a little worse than the
Simplo battery sent on 22nd July.
<p>
I don't know whether the
performance difference I observed between the Simplo and the Sanyo
is just a matter of random differences between samples of each, or
possibly some difference in the testing environments (the seven hour
tests were run on different days). When I tested the original Simplo
battery its performance was even worse than the Sanyo performance
shown above, but when I tested it I had already been using it
intermittently for about five weeks.
<p>
When I tested the second Simplo battery it was brand new, but also
had a relatively poor performance, lasting only 6 hours 18 minutes.
I don't know whether that relatively short time was a result of
my not having fully charged the battery (because of the charging
fault), or something about the conditions of testing.
<p>
The third Simplo was significantly better, and exceeded the
performance of the Sanyo. But it was not as good as the Samsung had
been when tested after five weeks. Since then the maximum charge
capacity of the Samsung seems to have dropped by about 2.3% (over
five weeks -- not shown in the diagram.)

John Cordiner at Dell
UK support has been very helpful in dealing
with my complaints, though there have been unexplained discrepancies
between what he asked the courier service used by Dell
<a href="http://www.echoltd.com/">(Echo)</a> to do, and what they
actually did.

<b>Disclaimer</b>
<br/>
I am not an expert on battery technology. I do not know what the
expected range of variation should be between batteries designed and
sold for the same specification. I do not know whether there was
some feature of my testing process that invalidated the results
obtained.
<p>
If anyone has more detailed information or corrections, please let
me know, if possible with links to sources of information.
<p>
Thanks
