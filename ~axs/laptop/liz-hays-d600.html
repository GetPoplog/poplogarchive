Hi,
<P>
Thanks for posting your
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/">notes on getting hibernate to work on the Dell</a>
600!
This was
really great.  I found your site extremely helpful and
thought I'd emphasize a couple small tweaks I had to apply for my system
in case it might help someone else - I didn't find specific information
relating to these problems.  I also have a Dell 600 and have recently
done a fresh install of FC3.
<P>
After the base FC3 install (from scratch) I installed the prebuilt
2.6.12-1.1380_FC3 build for the 2.6.12.6pre kernel from Matthias
Hensler's site for SWSUSP version 2.1.9.9 following your and his
directions, but when I returned from hibernate my pointer failed and
additionally the wireless wouldn't load properly.
<P>
My pointer disappearance problem was solved by adding options to the
video section of my xorg.conf file.  I borrowed these from
<a href="http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~andersen/fedora2latitude600.html">http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~andersen/fedora2latitude600.html</a>

# original xorg.conf entry
Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Videocard0"
        Driver      "radeon"
        VendorName  "Videocard vendor"
        BoardName   "ATI Radeon Mobility M9"
# added the following
        Option      "AGPMode" "4"
        Option      "EnablePageFlip" "on"
</PRE>

The wireless issue gave me the following messages on resume:
<PRE>
Nov  8 19:51:20 localhost kernel: ipw2200: Intel(R) PRO/Wireless

Nov  8 19:51:26 localhost kernel: ipw2200: probe of 0000:02:03.0 failed
    with error -5
</PRE>

It was an interrupt problem that was resolved by adding the following
option to my grub.conf:
<PRE>
    acpi=noirq
</PRE>

Here's my current full kernel line:
<PRE>
      kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.12-1.1380_FC3_cubbi1_swsusp2 ro
        root=LABEL=/1 rhgb=off quiet resume2=swap:/dev/hda5 vga=834 acpi=noirq
</PRE>

Anyway, I wasn't sure where to send this since I didn't find many sites
relating to hibernate on the Dell 600 for FC3 specifically.  If you know
of somewhere else that it might be helpful for me to post this, let me know.
<P>
