FEDORA CORE 3 AND SOFTWARE SUSPEND
<BR>ON DELL LATITUDE D600 LAPTOP
</B></H1>

This is an addendum (30th May 2005, further modified 5th and 7th
Jun 2005, then 1st July 2005) to my notes on
<a href="d600-linux.html">Linux on my D600</a>
<P>
<H2><B>
BACKGROUND
</B></H2>
In August 2003 I installed RedHat 9 on my Dell D600, and over a period
of several months gradually found how to get software suspend (<a
href="http://www.suspend2.net/">SWSUSP</a>) working to my satisfaction
as described <a href="d600-linux.html">here</a>, eventually using
an upgraded
kernel (version 2.4.26) and upgraded XFree86 installation (version 4.4)
which overcame various problems related to the radeon graphic card.
<P>
I was then reluctant to upgrade to a 2.6 kernel until I was certain that
SWSUSP was working on 2.6, as I used suspend all the time, hardly ever
rebooting the laptop since it was so much more convenient and
time-saving to suspend and resume without losing state.
<P>
I finally decided in May 2005 to upgrade to Fedora Core 3 partly because
I found that some software I needed (e.g. the new 'pwc' driver for
Philips webcam and related cameras required a 2.6 kernel), and partly
because the information at
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">Matthias Hensler's web site</a>
made it look easy and safe to do. I now have a very satisfactory
configuration running Fedora Core 3, with upgrades described below.
<P>
<H2><B>
Installing FC 3: If possible avoid 'upgrade' option
</B></H2>
The FC 3 installation CD gave me the option of an upgrade or a fresh
install. I decided to try the upgrade, though on reflection a fresh
install would have saved a number of minor problems. The upgrade went
very quickly because I was asked no questions about required packages:
the installation program merely decided what to install on the basis of
what had previously been installed, which I think is a bad design
decision. E.g. as a result it wasted my time installing an out of date
version of OpenOffice which I later removed, and I still do not know if
there were any new packages that I would have selected had I seen the
list.
<P>
Nevertheless the installation gave me a mostly working FC 3 installation
in about an hour. Even the linuxant driverloader package made my
built-in wireless card work with the new kernel to my surprise, because
linuxant had installed a boot script which checked whether the module
needed to be rebuilt for the current kernel. It slowed down the first
boot a little, but then just worked.
<P>
The new installation only 'mostly' worked, because a number of things no
longer worked (including pine, man, xine, mplayer, and a few others)
which I had to fix by removing things that had been left
by the `upgrade' installation and then install new versions. I think
this arose because I did not have a pure RedHat 9 installation: I had
been installing various things which I guess the FC 3 CD could not
upgrade to the new environment. Next time I'll do a fresh install, not
an upgrade.
<P>
Fixing problems was was simplified after I installed
<a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/dag/fedora/3/i386/apt-0.5.15cnc6-4.1.fc3.rf.i386.html">the 'apt-get' utility.</a>
This made installing and upgrading many things much easier than I had
ever found it before. Not everything is available that way, as there are
still things that have to be fetched and installed 'manually'.
<P>
<H2><B>
Getting SWSUSP to work on FC 3
</B></H2>
After solving the problems of upgrading to FC 3, getting sofware suspend
to work was very much easier than it had been with RH 9 and the 2.4
kernels. I did not even need the kernel source, because a pre-built
kernel available in rpm format, along with a few other utilities, could
be downloaded and installed from
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">Matthias Hensler's web
site</a>.
<P>

In particular installing SWSUSP is dead easy now. I used 'wget' to fetch
the files listed, as follows (thanks to the instructions on
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/index_en.php">http://mhensler.de/swsusp/index_en.php</a>

<P>
Install using 'rpm -i', to make the 'hibernate' command available.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Edit the /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf</B>
<BR>
Run 'hibernate -h' to get information on the options available then edit
the hibernate.conf file.
<BR>
You may find it easiest to copy

version</a>
-- which is worth reading,though you could try just using
it
<P>

<LI>
<B>Fetch and install a prebuilt FC kernel including SWSUSP</B>
<br>
The pre-built kernels available
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">here</a>
are updated from time to time. The one I am currently using is
a kernel
package including SWSUSP version 2.1.9, namely

http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download/kernel-2.6.11-1.27_FC3_cubbi3_swsusp2.i686.rpm
</a>

<P>
As instructed on the download page, install (as root) with the
appropriate command of the form
<PRE>
    'rpm -ivh XXXXXXXXX.rpm'
</PRE>
The download page states:
<blockquote>
Please install the kernels with 'rpm -ivh kernel_version.rpm'. This will
install the kernel without deleting the old one, so you can go back to a
working kernel in case of problems.
</blockquote>
<P>
After installing you'll see the new kernel along with older ones, in the
'/boot directory. You should also check the contents of your grub.conf
file (see below);
<PRE>
    /boot/grub/grub.conf
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
<B>Fix bootloader (grub or lilo) config file.</B>
<BR>
Check which device is your swapdevice. It should be specified in
/etc/fstab. E.g. it could be something like /dev/hda6
<P>
If you use grub (as I do) edit /boot/grub/grub.conf, adding
<PRE>
    resume2=swap:/dev/???
</PRE>
to the kernel command line, where ??? is the name of your swapdevice.
<P>
If you use lilo, edit /etc/lilo.conf in the same way and then run lilo.

<B>Get the shell script to modify the 'initrd' file</B>
<br>
Download
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download/swsusp2initrd.sh">the script
provided</a>.
and make it executable.
<P>
As instructed in
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/index_en.php">the SWSUSP 'Setup' page</a>
you can either modify the appropriate initrd img file in your /boot
directory 'by hand' or do it by running the above script with the initrd
path name as parameter, e.g.
<PRE>
   ./swsusp2initrd.sh  /boot/initrd-KERNEL_VERSION.img
</PRE>
As a precaution you could save the initrd file first. But in my
experience so far the shell script just works.

<P>
<B>ALTERNATIVELY:</B>
fetch and install the modified mkinitrd now available on
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/">http://mhensler.de/swsusp/</a>
</UL>

<H2><B>
Test it
</B></H2>
After all that you should be able to shut down and reboot, then
test the above by running the 'hibernate' command on the console, or
in an xterm window. In case of problems restoring X, you may prefer
the first time to test this in a plain text console. E.g. if you
are running X log in on console 2, by doing this to get the console
login prompt:

<PRE>
    CTRL+ALT+F2
</PRE>

You can then log in and run 'hibernate'. You should get what looks like
the beginning of a normal shutdown, followed by a display of progress
writing to the swap device. Then the machine shuts down. This is much
faster than a normal shutdown.
<P>
Then when you reboot, if you run the new kernel it should detected the
saved state on the swap device, and go into resume mode, including
showing the progress.
<P>

Warning: if you hibernate using one kernel, then later try to reboot
another kernel, then the next time you try to run the first kernel
it will complain about a corrupt file store.
<P>
So if you wish to run another kernel, do not hibernate: use the normal
shut down procedure.
<P>
However if you have windows installed, you can hiberate while running
linux, then run windows, then later reboot and resume the suspended
linux process.
<P>

<H2><B>
My experience so far: Fixing two minor annoyances
</B></H2>
After doing the above, everything seemed to work fine: after suspend and
resume USB devices including a mouse, external memory devices, and web
cams just worked as expected.
<P>
When running a 2.4 kernel (based on Redhat 9) I sometimes found that if
I tried to play a video file after resuming with the external power
supply disconnected, sound and video did not work properly. I then had
to suspend again, connect the charger, then resume. But I no longer have
that problem.
<P>
Two annoyances remained, that were easily overcome, though finding out
how took a bit of time. First of all the text displayed during boot and
resume was unreadable: something was corrupting the display during most
of the process. I tracked that down to this entry in the
/boot/grub/grub.conf file:
<PRE>
    splashimage=(hd0,5)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
</PRE>

I don't know how it got there but after I removed it booting and
resuming worked without problems. I could see all the text displayed.
<P>
The second annoyance was font size in the text console. The screen is
capable of 1400x1050 resolution and when I ran 2.4.26, that resolution
had been used when rebooting or resuming, giving me many more lines of
text when working in console mode. With the help of google I found that
I could tell the boot process to use that resolution by adding
<PRE>
    vga=834
</PRE>

at the end of the 'kernel' line. So I now have the following

<PRE>
    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11-1.27_FC3_cubbi3_swsusp2 ro root=LABEL=/12 resume2=swap:/dev/hda3 pci=noacpi vga=834
</PRE>

and everything is fine.
<P>
I think resuming is a little faster since the upgrade to FC3, but it is
hard to be sure, as I don't have a test configuration that could be
timed using 2.4.6 and the new kernel.
<P>

NOTE ADDED 26 Jun 2005 [UPDATED 1 Jul 2005]
</B></FONT><BR>
The fault reported in this section has disappeared. At first I thought
it was because I upgraded
the linuxant.com driverloader
(<a href="http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader">www.linuxant.com/driverloader</a>)
but I now think there is a different explanation, below.
<P>
<B>
This following paragraph is now out of date:
</B>
<br>
Since the upgrade mentioned below on 5th June 2005, everything works
perfectly except for one small irritation. Whenever it resumes, the
wireless card (Dell Trumobile 1300, using linuxant driverloader)
switches between eth0 and eth1. If before suspend eth1 was the wireless
interface, then after resume eth0 is and vice versa. Since I am not
using the ethernet interface I have made these two files identical:
<PRE>
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
</PRE>
My conjecture is that the cause of this was having the line
<PRE>    DownInterfaces eth0 eth1</PRE>
in /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf
<br>
I now have only
<PRE>    DownInterfaces eth1</PRE>

Note on upgrade on 5th June 2005
</B></H3>
I originally fetched the kernel package including SWSUSP
version 2.1.8.9
<BR>
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download/kernel-2.6.11-1.27_FC3_cubbi1_swsusp2.src.rpm">http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download/kernel-2.6.11-1.27_FC3_cubbi1_swsusp2.src.rpm</a>
<P>
This mostly worked, but I had noticed a couple of times that there was a
problem with resume, though sometimes a failed resume could be repeated
successfully. However  noticed that there was an upgraded kernel package
dated 2005/06/02  for kernel 2.6.11-1.27_FC3 including SWSUSP version
2.1.9, with the comment:
<P>
<blockquote>
"This new kernel fixes some security issues and includes recent software
suspend with fbsplash patch. It also should fix the issue with a panic
on resume some reported for the previous kernel."
</blockquote>
So I downloaded and installed it as above and so far (7 Jun 2005)
everything seems to be OK.

NOTE on Philips Web Cam (pwc) driver
</B></H3>
After installing a 2.6.11 kernel I had to fetch a new version of the
philips web cam driver (PWC) as described in

I hope this information is of use to someone.
<P>
I am very grateful to all the people who have done the work from which I
can now benefit. Every time I struggle to help my wife extricate herself
from a mess on her Windows PC I wish she could migrate to linux.
Unfortunately she uses a superb orienteering map-making package (OCAD)
which (at present) runs only on windows.
