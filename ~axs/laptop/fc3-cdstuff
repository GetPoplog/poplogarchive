After I installed Fedora core 3 I started having trouble reading,
writing, copying, and doing MD5 checksums on downloaded iso CD files,
because I prefer using shell scripts and shell commands to running
graphical tools. (I presume that for users of gnome and kde there are
graphical tools that remove the problems because they are regularly
updated, but I have not checked. In any case I use neither of them,
only the small, fast, robust, and tailorable ctwm window manager.)
<P>
I found an explanation of my problems and solutions that worked for me
at these two web sites:

The information provided there, including the shell scripts are
enormously helpful. However I have slightly modified the examples to
produce my own scripts, namely


<UL>
<LI>    <a href="rawread">rawread</a> device
<br> Reads in the contents of the device (e.g. /dev/cdrom, or
/dev/hdc) and copies all the data to the standard output. You can then
feed the output into a file, or a program.

This is from
<a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/coasterless.htm#rawread">http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/coasterless.htm#rawread</a>
<P>
I had thought that the code in there could be simplified to something
like this

<PRE>
    #!/bin/sh
    device=$1

    count=$(isosize -d 2048 $device)

    echo num of blocks = $count

    command="dd if=$device bs=2048 count=$count conv=notrunc,noerror"

    echo "$command" >&2

    $command
</PRE>

But something stops that working.

<P>
<LI>    <a href="copy-cd-to-iso">copy-cd-to-iso</a> device file
<BR>
Copy a CD to a file. e.g.
<PRE>    copy-cd-to-iso /dev/cdrom file.iso </PRE>
<P>
<LI>    <a href="check-cd-md5">check-cd-md5</a> device
<br>
Trivial script to run md5sum on a CD after writing it, using rawread.
<BR>
The output can be directed to a file e.g.
<PRE>    check-cd-md5 /dev/cdrom > file </PRE>
<P>
<LI>    <a href="copy-iso-to-iso">copy-iso-to-iso</a> file1 file2
<br>
Make a copy of an iso file, e.g. if you want to move it from one
partition to another.
<P>
<LI>    <a href="record-iso">record-iso</a> file device
<br>
Make a CD from an ISO file. E.g.
<PRE>     record-iso file.iso /dev/cdrom</PRE>
<P>
<LI>    <a href="mount-iso">mount-iso</a> isofile directory
<br>
Mount ISO image file.iso in directory (which must exist)
</UL>
