HELP POP_MOBILE_CONNECT                         Aaron Sloman, April 2010

LIB POP_MOBILE_CONNECT

-- Introduction

This is a collection of Pop-11 commands for use on linux with the
Huawei/T-mobile USB Web-n-walk stick based on Huawei E220 device.

These commands provide only a small subset of the full functionality of
the vodafone-mobile-connect utility, and everything here is text based.

Despite the limitations I have found the mechanism useful for sending
text messages, including purchasing a 7-day or 30-day pass, which
requires a text message to be sent via the device. As far as I know
tmobile do not provide a way to purchase the passes via the web
interface that can be used for pre-payment, inspecting usage records,
etc.

The package been tested ONLY on a t-mobile web-n-walk mobile broadband
USB stick bought in 2008. Some changes will be required for other
mobile-broadband devices.

This assumes that you have set up /etc/wvdial.conf appropriately and run
wvdial to make a connection to the tmobile service.

The procedure pmc_send takes a string, prepares a Ved file buffer (by default
it uses output.p -- edit the code to change this). It then reads any responses
from the modem channel until the end of response character sequence.
Everything read in is included in the Ved file buffer.

-- Making the commands available

Unfortunately, at present you are required to run this as superuser.

From Pop-11 or Ved give the following command to make all the procedures
listed below available.

    uses pop_mobile_connect

-- pmc_send(message);

The message must be text constituting one of the allowed formats for
communicating with the service.

-- pmc_clear();

Sends an empty string.

-- pmc_network();

pmc_network();

Produces something like this (after a lot of other stuff) in the Ved
file bufffer:

+COPS: (1,"T-Mobile UK","TMO UK","23430",2),(2,"T-Mobile UK","TMO UK","23430",0),,(0,1,2,3,4),(0,1,2)

-- pmc_getimsi();

Get IMSI Number

-- pmc_getmanufacturer();

-- pmc_service_centre();

-- SWITCHING MODES

-- -- pmc_textmode();
-- -- pmc_nontextmode();

-- SETTING CONNECTION PREFERENCES (3G/GPRS)

These have not been tested. It is not clear how useful they are.
Where the 3g quality is low it may be preferable to settle for
gprs only.

-- -- pmc_3g_pref();
-- -- pmc_3g_only();
-- -- pmc_gprs_pref();
-- -- pmc_gprs_only();

-- MESSAGE HANDLING PROCEDURES

Before trying to send or receive messages run

    pmc_textmode();

It does not seem to be necessary to run
    pmc_nontextmode();

before using internet services.

-- -- pmc_all_messages();

Retrieves all current messages which have not been deleted.

-- -- pmc_get_message(n);

Fetch message number n (0 is first message).

-- -- pmc_del_message(n);

Delete message number n (0 is first message).

-- -- pmc_send_message(number, text);

Send the text to the phone number.

The text should be a pop-11 string of characters suitable for an SMS
message. (e.g. avoid character sequences that function as modem control
signals!)

Number should be a text string containing the full phone number, e.g.

    pmc_send_message('+441214144775', 'Hi Aaron does your office phone accept text?');

(NB that example will not work!)

-- MESSAGES REQUESTING PASSES
-- -- pmc_7_day_pass();

This will send the message
    7 DAY
to tmobile number
    441

NB
    The charge for a 7 day pass will be deducted from your account!

At the time of writing, the cost is GBP 7 (i.e. half price, saving 7)


-- -- pmc_30_day_pass();

This will send the message
    30 DAY
to tmobile number
    441

NB
    The charge for a 30 day pass will be deducted from your account!

At the time of writing, the cost is GBP 15 (i.e. half price, saving GBP 45)
