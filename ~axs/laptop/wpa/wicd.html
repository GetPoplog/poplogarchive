<b>20 Jun 2009: Problem with wicd and selinux on Fedora 10</b>
<br/>
After a recent kernel update I started having problems: wicd would
no longer connect to wireless networks and I was getting error
messages from dhclient in /var/log/messages.
<p>
I solved the problem by running system-config-selinux and setting
permissive mode.

<p>
It is possible to reset selinux to the secure mode after a
connection has been made.
<p>
NOTE ADDED 26 Jun 2010: I now disable selinux completely in
<pre>
    /etc/selinux/config
by using
    SELINUX=disabled
</pre>

<b>2 Jun 2009: Fedora 10, using wcid</b>
<br/>
For unknown reasons I started having difficulty connecting to
wireless networks after upgrading my three and a half year old Dell
latitude D610 from F9 to F10. My old scripts using wpa_supplicant
did not connect as reliably as they used to, and I could not get
NetworkManager to do anything useful. I had previously, when using
Fedora 9, found that for connection to public services, e.g. at
airports, 'wlassistant' worked well, but I found even that
failing to connect after recent upgrades of the kernel.
<p>
However I have now discovered that 'wicd' (pronounced 'Wicked'?)
works very well, although it means I have to stifle my dislike of
graphical interfaces. I would much prefer to find a way to get my
old scripts working. But for now 'wicd' works instead, as described
below. My thanks to
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~djd/">Damien Duff</a>
for advice when I first started it up.
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE ADDED 26 Jun 2010: need to run 'dhclient -r'</b>
<br/>
I later found a web site suggesting that there was a problem with
dhclient not releasing connections properly.
<br/>
I was then able to get my scripts working again, by doing the
following after starting wpa supplicant (run either as root, or
using 'sudo'):
<pre>
    # release any previous dhcp lease
    dhclient -r

    # start up a new dhcp connection using eth1
    dhclient eth1 -v

    ###(also works with 'wlan0' instead of 'eth1' on Fedora 13)
</pre>
The '-v' flag is not necessary but provides useful information about
how the connection process is proceeding, and when it has succeeded.

<b>Wicd on Ubuntu Intrepid</b>
<br/>
It seems that some users of Ubuntu Intrepid who were having trouble
with NetworkManager find that 'wicd' works fine.
<br/>

<b>Installing wicd on Fedora 10</b>
<br/>
I fetched the latest stable version (wicd-1.5.9) from here:
<pre>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=194573">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=194573</a>
</pre>
and followed the instructions here:
<pre>
    <a href="http://wicd.net/moinmoin/Wicd%20on%20FC9">http://wicd.net/moinmoin/Wicd%20on%20FC9</a>.
</pre>
(apart from changing the 'wget'
command to fetch a more recent version, 1.5.9, selected from the
sourceforge web site.)
I did not have the problems with selinux mentioned in the moinmoin
message.
<p>
<b>Using wicd on Fedora 10</b>
<br/>
Wicd has two components, a server and a client. After installation I
ran 'system-config-services'. I used that to disable NetworkManager,
and to ensure that the 'wicd' service was running.
<p>
Then to get the client running I typed, in an xterm window:
<pre>
    wicd-client -n
</pre>
That brought up a panel showing available networks. See the
image below (shown after connection was completed):
<p>
<img alt="wicd" src="wicd-0.png"/>
<p>
In some parts of the building it showed more options, including
UOBGuest.
<p>
In principle it would be possible to invoke wicd via a mouse menu,
or have it launched automatically when X11 starts up. For now I am
happy to give the above command to start it up.

<p>
To configure a
network (eg. UOBWLAN) click on the white right-pointing triangle
next to the name.   That brings in two more buttons labelled
'Scripts' and 'Advanced settings'.
<p>
<img alt="wicd" src="wicd-1.png"/>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Click on the Advanced settings. That brings up a smaller panel:
<li>
Select 'Use encryption'. That will make the panel expand to display
a pull-down menu and some text input windows (that will depend on
which menu option you choose).
<p>
<img alt="wicd" src="wicd-2.png"/>
<p>
<li>
From the menu choose 'PEAP with GTC' ('Generic Token Card'?) if you
don't want to specify a certificate, or 'PEAP with TKIP' if you want
to specify a certificate that you have downloaded. (I used the
former, as shown in the snapshot).
<p>
<b>NB 26 Jun 2010: a certificate is required for the new service: uobwifi.</b>
<br/>
So choose 'PEAP with TKIP'.
<br/>
See
<a href="http://www.wireless.bham.ac.uk/start/configuration/linux.shtml">http://www.wireless.bham.ac.uk/start/configuration/linux.shtml</a>
<br/>
(Shows how to connect using NetworkManager applet.)
<br/>
My instructions for using the uobwifi connection on linux are
<a href="uobwifi.html">here</a>.
<br/>
The new certificate (required from summer 2010) is here
<a href="http://webdev1.bham.ac.uk/uob_root_linux.pem">http://webdev1.bham.ac.uk/uob_root_linux.pem</a>
<br/>
Place it in /etc/cert or wherever you keep certificates. (You may
have to create the directory, as superuser.)
<p>

<li>
Type in your user name (identity) and
password. If you select the boxes on the
right the text will be visible.
<br/>
NB: If you use the 'eduroam' service you will need to type in
username followed by '@bham.ac.uk' (you can't use
your 'cs.bham.ac.uk' user name.)
<p>
<li>
Then click on 'OK'
<p>
<li>
Click on 'Connect'. After a delay during which the connection is
attempted, you should get success indicated at the bottom of the
panel, showing 'Connected to UOBWLAN at 80%', and the IP address.
(See the first image above).
</ul>
<p>
I have found that once the connection has been made I can click on
'quit' to get rid of the wicd window, and the connection goes on
working.
<p>
It also connects with my wireless access point at home using
WPA-PSK+TKIP.
