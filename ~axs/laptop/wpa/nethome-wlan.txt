## Script for restarting wireless connection to WPA access point

## Slightly different versions of this needed for connecting to
## different networks, e.g. at work, travelling etc.

## The home dependent files are stored in these directories

#   /etc/home
#   contains versions of these files in /etc for use at home:
#       hosts
#       hosts.allow
#       hosts.deny
#       resolv.conf   (not really needed with dhcp connection)
#
#   /etc/wpa_supplicant/home
#   contains
#       wpa_supplicant.conf
#
#       (It may be possible to use one version of that file with
#       different entries for different access points. The version
#       for use on campus or with eduroam requires passwords, so the /etc
#       directory should really be on an encrypted disk partition)
#
#   /etc/sysconfig/home
#   contains versions of these files in /etc/sysconfig for use at home:
#       network
#       wpa_supplicant
#
#   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/home
#   contains versions of these files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
#   for use at home:
#       ifcfg-eth0
#       ifcfg-wlan0

## For other versions of this script, for use in other contexts,
## replace 'home' with a different label. This is clumsy and will be
## replaced by something more structured.


## Start by turning things off.

cd /root

echo 're-setting nethome network connection'

echo 'disabling eth0 wlan0'

/sbin/ifdown eth0

/sbin/ifdown wlan0

/sbin/service network stop

/sbin/service wpa_supplicant stop

## Now go to /etc/ and fix files there

cd /etc

rm -f resolv.conf hosts

cp -p home/* .

cd /etc/wpa_supplicant

cp -p home/* .


## Now go to /etc/sysconfig and fix files there
cd /etc/sysconfig

cp -p home/* .


## Now go to /etc/sysconfig/network-scriipts and fix files there

cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

rm -f ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-wlan0

cp -p home/* .


## Now restart network service, power up wireless, etc.

/sbin/service network restart

/sbin/ifdown wlan0

echo "Power up wlan0"

/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 txpower on

echo "restart wpa_supplicant"

/sbin/service wpa_supplicant start;

## Allow time to associate with wpa access point

echo "sleep 6"
sleep 6

## display status:
echo "iwconfig wlan0"

/sbin/iwconfig wlan0

## dhcp will provide /etc/resolve.conf so remove old one

cd /etc

rm -f resolv.conf

echo "restarting dhclient"

## clear any old dhcp receipt
/sbin/dhclient wlan0  -r

## try to get IP address for wireless connection,
# using -v to display progress.
/sbin/dhclient -v -I lape  wlan0

## Print out status. Will show IP address if successful
/sbin/ifconfig wlan0
