The instructions are for use of the 'eduroam' network. I presume

<br/>
He used the instructions below
to set up a Nokia E65 for both Eduroam and UOBWLAN.
<br/>
Some menus had very
slightly different names but everything was in the right place.
<br/>
There was a problem with <a href="#certificate"> the link
to the GTECybertrust certificate</a>
below, but he was able to download it to
his desktop then email it to the phone.

work for both eduroam and UOBWLAN on this device which runs Symbian S60
5th edition.

I can confirm that these settings worked for me on my Nokia E61: some
of the settings were in slightly different places but once I had set
all of them, it worked.

Thanks!
