WARNING (Aug 2013):
The instructions below are out of date, as linux systems,
<br/>
including NetworkManager now handle wifi security differently.

Using wpa_supplicant on Linux to Connect to the

<b>NB</b>
<br/>
These notes assume that you already have a working wireless card, which
you have tested on some other wireless network.
<br>
If your wireless card is not working, try to configure it using
'system-config-network' or some other tool that works on your system, or
ask a friend for help. Come back when the card works and has been tested
on another more easily accessible wireless network, so that you are sure
that you have the right drivers for your wireless card and it has been
properly recognised by your operating system.

In addition, please note that some of the helpdesk staff in Information
Services are able to help users who wish to use a linux laptop to access
the campus wireless service, but they
will not physically change settings on
user machines. That is the responsibility of users.
<p>
However, the Information Services web site now does give advice for
linux users, and you should try their instructions, using
NetworkManager, before trying mine. See:

<br/>
General information about configuration for use of UOBwifi

Information about the old service is here
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.helpdesk.bham.ac.uk/laptopsurgery/linux.shtml">http://www.helpdesk.bham.ac.uk/laptopsurgery/linux.shtml</a>

DO NOT use the certificate mentioned there for the new service.

<h3><b>
Introduction: UOBwifi with new certificate, Starting March 2010
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
The following information was provided by Chris Lea in Information
Services on 26 Mar 2010.
<p>
He agreed that I could pass it on, after
testing the new service.
<p>
The campus WIFI certificate is changing because JANET(UK) have
changed the certifying authority for their certificate service.
<br/>
Details here
<a href="http://www.ja.net/services/scs/">http://www.ja.net/services/scs/</a>
<p>
The Globalsign certificates are due to expire this summer so we need
to replace with new and get everyone validating authentications
against the new certificate.
<p>
It has been decided by someone that the best (least painful)
approach is to run a new wireless SSID: UOBwifi against the new cert
whilst running the current service UOBWLAN to expiration. This will
give people time to migrate to the new service before the old one is
phased out.
</blockquote>
<h3><b>
Changes and Actions Required
</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>
The name of the service (SSID) is changing from <b>UOBWLAN</b> to
<b>UOBwifi</b>.
<br/>
So network settings will have to be altered to accommodate this.
<p>
<li>
<b>WARNING Added 12 Jun 2013</b>
<br/>
The certificate specified below stopped working for me in June 2013.
<br/>
I had to convert it from the .pem form to the .der form, as described
<a href="wpa.html#certificate">here</a> (another file).
<br/>
The .pem  certificate used is available from
<a href="http://webdev1.bham.ac.uk/uob_root_linux.pem">webdev1.bham.ac.uk/uob_root_linux.pem</a>
<p>
E.g. linux users can fetch it using this command, or something
similar:
<pre>
    wget webdev1.bham.ac.uk/uob_root_linux.pem
</pre>
<p>
<li>
Install the certificate in /etc/cert or wherever you put your
certificates.
<p>
<li>
Update your system's information about the new service name and the
location of the new certificate.
<p>
This can be done in different ways, depending on the system you use.
<ul>
<li>
If you use Ubuntu or a similar system, or use network-manager or
wicd, look at this web site
<br/>
<small>
<a href="http://www.wireless.bham.ac.uk/start/configuration/linux.shtml">http://www.wireless.bham.ac.uk/start/configuration/linux.shtml</a>
</small>
<p>
If you use Fedora or something similar you may find my script and
files for profiling useful. They are available in this package
<small>
<pre>
    <a href="uobwifi.tar.gz">uobwifi.tar.gz</a>
</pre>
</small>
whose contents can be browsed online here:
<small>
<pre>
    <a href="uobwifi">uobwifi/</a>
    (Note added 12 Jun 2013: Superseded by new versions of wicd and NetworkManager)
</pre>
</small>
In particular the wpa_supplicant.conf file:
<small>
<pre>
    <a href="uobwifi/etc/wpa_supplicant/uobwifi/wpa_supplicant.conf">wpa_supplicant.conf</a>
</pre>
</small>
This contains
<ol>
<li>
a script to run to start the service, namely
<a href="uobwifi/startUOBwifi">startUOBwifi</a>
<p>
<li>
various <a href="uobwifi/etc">subdirectories</a>
of the /etc directory, containing files to be used with UOUBwifi,
namely:
</ol>
<small>
<pre>
<b>Certificate:</b>

DIR /etc/cert/
    containing
        /etc/cert/uob_root_linux.pem

<b>Text files specifying the profile (most optional)</b>

DIR /etc/uobwifi/
    containing
        /etc/uobwifi/hosts
        /etc/uobwifi/hosts.allow
        /etc/uobwifi/hosts.deny
        /etc/uobwifi/resolv.conf

DIR /etc/wpa_supplicant/
    containing
        /etc/wpa_supplicant/uobwifi/
            containing <b>(essential)</b>
            /etc/wpa_supplicant/uobwifi/wpa_supplicant.conf

DIR /etc/sysconfig/
    containing
        /etc/sysconfig/uobwifi/
        containing (optionally) scripts
            /etc/sysconfig/uobwifi/firewall
            /etc/sysconfig/uobwifi/network
            <b>Essential for telling wpa_supplicant what to do</b>
            /etc/sysconfig/uobwifi/wpa_supplicant

DIR /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
    containing
        /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/uobwifi/
        containing
            /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/uobwifi/ifcfg-eth1

            and optionally
            /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/uobwifi/ifcfg-eth0
</pre>
</small>

<p>
Those files are copied into place by the startUOBwifi script, above,
which then restarts the network service and wpa_supplicant service,
then calls dhclient to obtain a dhcp connection for eth1.
<p>
You should make sure that you have previous versions of those files
saved for use with other network services or local use.
</ul>

</ol>
