Fixed horrible flickering with skype and appear.in
</b></h3>
I had been using a couple of logitech webcams (B500 [1.3mp] and C270 [3mp]) for
skype or recording (using "cheese"). Both worked well with cheese, but flickered
badly with skype.
<p>
Eventually I found the solution here:
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/linuxenko/ubuntu-skylake-i915-video-fix">https://github.com/linuxenko/ubuntu-skylake-i915-video-fix</a>
<p>
Namely,

<pre>
    cd /tmp
    wget https://github.com/linuxenko/ubuntu-skylake-i915-video-fix/releases/download/v1/20-intel.conf
</pre>
That file has the following contents:

<pre>
   Section "Extensions"
           Option "XVideo" "Disable"
   EndSection

   Section "Device"
      Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
      Driver      "intel"
      Option      "AccelMethod" "sna"
      Option      "TearFree" "true"
      Option      "DRI" "true"
   EndSection
</pre>

Copy the file (as superuser) to this directory: /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d

<pre>
    cp 20-intel.conf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf
</pre>

Then re-start the X window system, if you have set things up to make that easy
without rebooting. Otherwise reboot.

<p>
On the few tests I have tried both skype and appear.in now both work fine.

<h3><b>
1 Oct 2016:
<br>
Found out how to make non-graphical Linux start with altered
key-map.
</b></h3>

Like many others I always work with functionality of CapsLock and CTRL
keys (on left of keyboard) swapped. That's because I use CTRL far more often and
it's less of a strain to use higher up the keyboard. For similar reasons I
prefer to swap the functions of the ESC and Grave keys at top left of the
keyboard: bringing the ESC key lower because I use it far more often, in editing
commands.
<p>
Performing those two swaps after linux has started up graphical mode can usually
be done on linux using "xmodmap" or a keyboard configuration tool. But I also
sometimes work in plain text mode, e.g. for software maintenance, or when
configuring a new version of linux. So I like to have the same keyswaps before
graphical mode starts. For many years that was easily achieved by editing
a file that is now located here (i.e. unzip it, edit it, then zip it):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwerty/uk.map.gz
<p>
But that file is now ignored when the linux systems I have been using
(Fedora-based) start up. After searching in vain for an alternative I eventually
discovered that this file can be edited instead:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/xkb/gb.map.gz
<p>
All I had to do was unzip the file, then swap the definitions for
keycode 1 and keycode 41 (to swap ESC and Grave keys) and swap the definitions
for keycodes 29 and 58 (to swap CTRL and CapsLock). I then found that on booting
into text mode the keys functioned exactly as I wanted, and that was also
preserved in graphical mode, making the use of xmodmap unnecessary.
<p>
I also had to inform the linux boot mechanism that I wanted a UK keyboard. That
was done by inserting the language label on the kernel specification
line in the file
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
<br>
I.e. in the line starting 'linux16 /vmlinuz', I included
'LANG=en_GB.UTF-8' as well as the '3' to indicate that I want the system to boot
into mode 3 (text mode) normally, though when resuming from hibernate, it will
go back to the previous mode, which is usually graphical mode.
<p>
Anyone using a
different language keyboard will have to use a different boot setting, and will
have to edit a different file in the directory
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/xkb/
<br>
There are over 300 to choose from! Anyone using the standard UK/GB keyboard
layout who wishes to use my key swaps can download a copy of my file here:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/kb/gb.map.gz">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/kb/gb.map.gz</a>
<br>
Then use it to replace the file
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/xkb/gb.map.gz
<p>
Of course most linux users would want to unzip both of them and compare their
contents. Even if you follow my instructions exactly I cannot guarantee that
this will work on your machine. If you end up with an unusable keyboard layout
you may have to restore the original gb.map.gz file, so keep a copy of it before
installing my version.
<p>
Normally, instead of shutting down at night I hibernate the machine and when it
is next switched on it returns to the previous state with all my editor windows,
browser windows, etc. still in place (on up to 12 different virtual desktops).
If a new kernel becomes available and I have reason to believe I need to install
it, then a complete shutdown is needed and a reboot, but I avoid that by
postponing kernel upgrades that I don't need. Fortunately I don't often need to
use my machine(s) in non-graphical mode, but it is useful to be able to do so.
<p>
The great advantage of the current system is that the same keyboard layout
configuration file is used both during the text only mode after booting (mode 3)
and the graphical mode (mode 5). It may not work if something goes wrong early
in a boot process and the system then defaults to a "maintenance" mode.

15 Oct 2013: Upgraded my desktop PC (Viglen Genie with 4-core Intel i5 CPU)
<br/>
from 32-bit Fedora 16 to 64-bit Fedora 19,
<br/>
using the XFCE lightweight 'spin' CD (Fedora-Live-XFCE-x86_64-19-1.iso).
<br/>
This mostly went very smoothly.

<b>Grub2 problems after installation, update and reboot</b>

</ul>

So far all the issues described below have been solved and I now find that both
<br/>
pm-hibernate (which allows me to go for months without rebooting) and pm-suspend
<br/>
(which I rarely use) work without any special manipulation of grub.cfg previously
<br/>
needed.
<ul>
<a name="glitch"></a>
<li>
<b>Temporary ethernet name glitch</b>
<br/>
During the installation the ethernet connection worked perfectly but the interface
<br/>
had a strange name ("en01" I think) that I had never previously encountered. However
<br/>
after the initial installation had completed and I had run 'yum update' to bring the
<br/>
system up to date, the network connection did not work after a reboot. It took me
<br/>
some time to work out that the interface name had changed to em1 as indicated by the
<br/>
new file
<pre>
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1
</pre>
Since then networking has been perfect, though I had a bit of trouble getting the
<br/>
firewall to allow local machines to connect to my PC via ssh, as the latest version
<br/>
of system-config-firewall confused me and I somehow failed to confirm one of the
<br/>
options I had chosen.
<br/>

<br/>
I think the installation process should make it clear that the network names found on
<br/>
first boot after installation will not survive after a full update. That warning
<br/>
could have saved me some effort.
<p>
<a name="fetchmail"></a>
<li>
<b>Fetchmail/Sendmail problem after installing Fedora 19 (Solved)</b>
<br/>
After installing sendmail I edited /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and /etc/mail/submit.cf
<br/>
to specify smtp.blueyonder.co.uk and created the 'auth' sub-directory with
<br/>
information required for SSL. Sendmail worked fine: I could post messages.
<br/>
Thunderbird was also able to read mail. <b>However fetchmail would not work.</b> It
<br/>
connected with the pop3 host and even found out how many messages were waiting,
<br/>
but it was unable to post them to me locally. Log file entries included:

<pre>
  fetchmail: 40 messages for recent:xxx@yyy at
  pop3.blueyonder.co.uk (8085778 octets).
  reading message recent:xxx@yyy@pop3.blueyonder.co.uk:1 of 40 (10516 octets) (log message incomplete)
  Connection errors for this poll:
  name 0: connection to localhost:smtp [127.0.0.1/25] failed: Connection refused
  ....
  SMTP connect to localhost failed
  SMTP transaction error while fetching from recent:xxx@yyy@pop3.blueyonder.co.uk and delivering to SMTP host localhost
  Query status=10 (SMTP)
</pre>
However, Thunderbird had no difficulty reading mail using pop3, but I dislike all the
<br/>
graphical email interfaces and prefer messages to be stored locally and processed in
<br/>
alpine or my programmable editor, Ved.
<br/>

<br/>
Eventually I removed the directory /etc/mail and copied over the version I had had
<br/>
working in Fedora 16. After that both sendmail and fetchmail worked.
<br/>

<br/>
The main differences between the broken and working sendmail.cf files in /etc/mail
<br/>
were as follows. The working version had these lines in it, whereas the version that
<br/>
did not work had different settings for the variables.
<pre>
 O DaemonPortOptions=Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MT

 O AuthMechanisms=EXTERNAL GSSAPI KERBEROS_V4 DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN

 # CA directory
 O CACertPath=/etc/mail/cert

 CA file
 O CACertFile=/etc/mail/cert/server.crt

 # Server Cert
 O ServerCertFile=/etc/mail/cert/server.crt

 # Server private key
 O ServerKeyFile=/etc/mail/cert/server.key.open

 # Client private key
 O ClientKeyFile=/etc/mail/cert/server.crt
</pre>

and in /etc/mail/submit.cf

<pre>
 # location of pid file
 O PidFile=/var/run/sm-client.pid
</pre>
I also had to ensure the existence of

<pre>
    /etc/mail/cert
</pre>

containing three files

<pre>
    -rw------- 1 root root 963 Apr 22  2012 server.key
    -rw------- 1 root root 891 Apr 22  2012 server.key.open
    -rw------- 1 root root 818 Apr 22  2012 server.crt
</pre>
 Instructions for creating and using those files are in
<pre>
<a href="http://www.cromwell-intl.com/linux/sendmail-ssl.html">http://www.cromwell-intl.com/linux/sendmail-ssl.html</a>
</pre>

Namely
<pre>
   1. Create a certificate directory and go there:

   # mkdir /etc/mail/cert
   # cd /etc/mail/cert

   2. Create a key for the server, giving a new pass phrase when prompted:

   # openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
   # openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.open

   3. Create a clear-text copy of the key (so it is not pass-phrase-protected), giving
   the pass phrase when asked:

   # openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key server.key.open -out server.crt

   4. Answer the X.509v3 questions appropriately.

   5. Make the files root-read-only:
   # chmod 600 server.*

Alternative method from that web page, using sendmail.mc, quoting:

 You can modify sendmail.mc instead of sendmail.cf and have your changes persist
 through make runs. Thanks to Dave Miller for pointing this out:

 dnl #
 define(`confCACERT_PATH', `/etc/mail/cert')dnl
 define(`confCACERT', `/etc/mail/cert/server.crt')dnl
 define(`confSERVER_CERT', `/etc/mail/cert/server.crt')dnl
 define(`confSERVER_KEY', `/etc/mail/cert/server.key.open')dnl
 define(`confCLIENT_KEY', `/etc/mail/cert/server.crt')dnl
 dnl#

</pre>
I think I must have used that advice several years ago, and forgotten.

<a name="ctwm-f19"></a>
<li>
<b>Window Manager (CTWM working)</b>
<br/>
I found the XFCE installation lightweight and speedy, and it wasn't too hard to
<br/>
select some of my preferred configuration settings (e.g. focus follows mouse, do
<br/>
not raise windows if clicked inside, increase number of workspaces to 12, set my
<br/>
preferred keyboard actions for cycling through workspaces, and raising-lowering
<br/>
windows.)
<br/>

<br/>
But I disliked always having clutter on the desktop (i.e. a panel) instead of being
<br/>
able to get what I wanted from a blank screen via mouse invoked menus or keyboard
<br/>
shortcuts. And xfce did not allow me to gain control of the 'F1' key, which it uses
<br/>
for 'help' functions, or to ensure that CTRL and CapsLock keys were swapped, and also
<br/>
ESC and Grave keys: both changes required for my sanity and avoidance of RSI as I use
<br/>
ESC and CTRL very frequently when editing papers, notes, email, etc. in my editor.
<p>
So I decided to go back to my old favourite, the CTWM window manager, which I
have consistently found more flexible and more easily programmable than any
other.
The home of ctwm changed recently, thanks especially to a lot of work done by
Matthew D. Fuller
You can now find it here:
<a href="http://www.ctwm.org/index.html">http://www.ctwm.org/index.html</a>
<br>
It may also be available as a pre-built package for your version of linux,
though compilation from source is very simple if you have cmake.
<p>
For more information about Matthew Fuller go to
<a href="http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/">http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/</a>.
<p>
Google showed me that CTWM was available for Fedora 19 here:
<br/>
<a href="http://pkgs.org/fedora-19/rpm-sphere-x86_64/ctwm-3.8a-30.1.x86_64.rpm.html">http://pkgs.org/fedora-19/rpm-sphere-x86_64/ctwm-3.8a-30.1.x86_64.rpm.html</a>
To install:
<pre>
  1. Create the repository config file /etc/yum.repos.d/rpm-sphere.repo:

    [rpm-sphere]
    name=RPM Sphere
    baseurl=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/zhonghuaren/Fedora_19/
    gpgkey=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/zhonghuaren/Fedora_19/repodata/repomd.xml.key
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1

  2. Install ctwm rpm package:

    # yum install ctwm
</pre>

After that I could use my old .xinitrc files to start X, my .ctwmrc files to
<br/>
configure the window manager and the 'startx' command to go from console mode to
<br/>
graphical mode. I altered the boot entry to start up in console (non-graphical) mode
<br/>
by adding '3' at the end of the 'linux' line, and removing 'rhgb' and 'quite' so as
<br/>
to see the text displayed during booting. In graphical mode I find CTWM much nicer
<br/>
than any other graphical interface I have used, though it may not meet everyone's
<br/>
preferences.

<b>Grub2 problems after installation, update and reboot</b>
<br/>
I wished to keep my /boot partition with entries for the Fedora 16 system so that I
<br/>
could easily go back to an earlier version if the upgrade to F19 failed, or did not
<br/>
work well.
<br/>

<br/>
But the installer got confused about what to put in the grub.cfg files defining the
<br/>
boot menu. I'll document that in a fedora bug report, though it seems to be a fault
<br/>
in 'grubby' the program apparently used to install boot information.

5 Aug 2012: Getting Logitech QuickCam Orbit/Sphere USB webcam to work with USB Microphone
<br/>
<small>
As my laptop has an integrated webcam, this is relevant only to linux on my Desktop
machine (then running Fedora 16).
<br/>
I had been having trouble using a USB Webcam with a USB microphone, e.g. when using Skype,
both plugged into USB sockets on the front panel of the PC. Audio worked but not video.
<p>
Thanks to a tip found on the internet I tried instead plugging the Webcam into a USB
extender connected to one of the back USB sockets, and that fixed the problem. It seems
that the two front USB sockets share some hardware that cannot be used simultaneously for
two Audio or video devices -- or something like that!
<br>
See also <a href="#webcam">above note</a> about Logitech B500 webcam: this has an
integrated microphone which seems to be just as good as or possibly better than, the
stand-alone microphone, so the need to use front and back usb sockets no longer
exists.

12 Apr 2012: UPDATE: WARNING ABOUT GRUB2: Problem is use of 'Grubby'
<br/>
31 May 2012: UPDATE: This problem seems to have been fixed
</b></h3>
The Fedora command 'yum install kernel' uses the 'grubby' program to
update /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.
<br/>
This had a serious bug that has caused problems for me and at least one
other user. The problem has now been diagnosed and fixed (May 2012).
Grubby previously used the contents of /etc/fstab to identify the root
partition to go into the grub.cfg file. An error in the root partition
entry in the fstab file will not affect booting, since it cannot be read
until the root partition has been mounted. But that error in grub.cfg
can make booting impossible.
<p>
It turns out that at least two people
reporting the bug had somehow inadvertently got an error in the fstab
file, which was propagated to grub.cfg every time the kernel was
updated, requiring grub.cfg to be edited to enable booting to occur.
<br/>
I have inserted a bug report
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=756559#c9">here
-- comment 9 (typo fixed in comment 10)</a>

<b>Update 1 Apr 2012</b>
<br>
I wrote earlier.
Using the right boot flag seems to have fixed the problem of
resume after pm-hibernate sometimes not complete the "thaw", and then rebooting.
<br/>
On the Dell E6410 laptop, running Fedora 16 with this special patched kernel
<pre>
    3.3.0-7.1.fc16.i686 #1 SMP Wed Mar 28 19:04:51 UTC 2012
</pre>
I seem to be able to suppress the rebooting by using acpi=noirq
in the grub.cfg boot menu file. See <a href="#resume-problem">below</a>.
<br/>
But the success did not continue. Likewise with kernel 3.3.0-8.fc16.i686
-- using acpi=noirq did not ensure that resume works. It gets near the
end of the resume process, then screen goes blank and it reboots.
<br/>
My liveable-with solution to the resume failing problem is described in
<a href="hibernate-on-linux.html">this file.</a>
<br/>
I tried using 'acpi_sleep=nonvs' as recommended on a web site, but it did
not enable resume to work.

Changes in /proc/acpi since kernel 3.2
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Since kernel 3.2, /proc/acpi no longer contains the wakeup file and battery
and ac_adapter directories. Instead it now contains only /proc/wakeup and
the directory
<pre>
  /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/
</pre>
which has a file 'state' showing whether lid is open or closed. This
means that my home-grown utility for checking battery levels no longer
works. It turns out that the information is now in a different format
under /sys. E.g. to find out whether a charger is plugged in, this
produces '1' or '0':
<pre>
    cat /sys/class/power_supply/AC/online
</pre>
Some of the information that was previously in
<pre>
    /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state
    /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info
</pre>
can now be found in
<pre>
    /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/
e.g.
    /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/uevent
</pre>
E.g. useful information can can be extracted from the output of

    cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/uevent | grep -v NAME | grep -v PRESENT \

<blockquote>
I bought the version of the microphone offered on Amazon. When plugged in it is
recognized as
<pre>
    Product: AK5370
    Manufacturer: AKM
</pre>
I used 'pavucontrol' to select the AK5370 in the 'Configuration'
tab, setting 'Analog mono input'. (It's not a stereo mic.)
<br/>
In the 'Input devices' tab, I use the 'Show' menu bar to select
'All input devices'. On my machine that shows four input
devices.
<br/>
I set the volume slider for 'AJ5379 I/F A/D Converter Analog Mono'
to somewhere between 50% and maximum. (Experimentation is needed.)
<p>
On all the other volume sliders (all stereo with two sliders):
<pre>
    'Monitor source of simultaneous output to internal Audio Analog Stereo'
    'Monitor of internal Audio Analog Stereo'
    'Internal Audio Analog Stereo' (on Microphone 1)
</pre>
I select Silence (0%), with slider button on left.
<p>
On the 'Output Devices' tab I set the 'Show' menu bar at bottom to
'All Output Devices'.  The set the slider for 'Simultaneous output
to internal Audio Analog Stereo' sliders (two) to zero or muted
(using the 'mute' button with the 'x'.
<br>
The other pair of sliders, labelled 'Internal Audio Analog Stereo'
must not be muted. The appropriate level will depend on whether you
are using headphones or speakers, with or without amplification. (I
have twin black logitek speakers with a 'Bass' box containing on off
switch.
<p>
On the 'Recording' tab, I select Show: Virtual streams. That reveals
the level of input from the mike, but there's nothing to control.
<p>
On the 'Playback' tab I select Show: All streams.
<br/>
The Sound recorder playback stream is not shown until you actually
play something from the sound recorder.
<br/>
I set the 'System' sounds (mono) volume control to about 15% (e.g.
for Skype warnings and others.)
<br/>
There
is also a pair of sliders for
'Simultaneous output on internal Audio Analog Stereo', and a volume
level display. I set that 'Muted'.
<p>
To test those settings I launch gnome-sound-recorder (which had to
be installed using 'yum install').
<br>
Set the 'Record from input:' menu bar to 'Capture'. There is no
other option for it on my machine.
<br/>
Set the 'Record as:' menu bar to whatever you want.
<br/>
I've tried 'CD
Quality, Lossy (.ogg type)' and 'voice, Lossless (.wav type)'.
<br/>
I can't hear any difference, but if you save a recording the .ogg
version is smaller.
<br>
If your machine has a different sound card you will probably get
different options.
<br/>
Mine is integrated intel sound, on the
motherboard. It's slightly different between my desktop machine and
laptop, but the above explanation should work for both contexts.

NEWS 4 Jan 2012: Tried out 'live' CD for Fedora 16 LXDE 'spin'.

<small>
Found that it worked very well, including booting up quickly, and
handling the screen at full resolution.
<br/>
For the first time NetworkManager let me connect to my wireless router
during initial boot off the CD.
<br/>
However, it became a nuisance after install to hard drive and initial
upgrade, so I disabled it and installed wicd instead. But having it
on the live CD proved very useful. I don't know why it stopped
working after 'Install to hard drive'.
<br/>
Wicd is very much better and should replace NetworkManager as the
default on Linux. Unfortunately various linux packages (e.g.
Anaconda) assume that NetworkManager is the one and only true
network connector. So I have had to remove Anaconda on my machine.
It seems not to matter. Likewise I have removed Selinux, which just
causes problems.
<br/>
My general impression is that this is the first version of linux
(fedora?) that is completely usable on Dell Latitude E6410, from the
start, including the Intel Graphics and SD card reader.

Dell Latitude E6410 with Intel Graphics Using 32bit Fedora 15
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
I started using RedHat linux around 1999, then used various versions of Fedora.
Fedora has improved enormously over the years (partly to meet the challenge of Ubuntu?)
<p>
When I first got the laptop in June 2010 I could not get graphics working properly in
linux, with the Intel graphic card, though I did eventually find a configuration
based on a particular fedora 13 kernel, which I went on using for several months, as
described <a href="#f13-intel">here.</a>
<p>
In March 2011, I started using the "Alpha" version of Fedora 15, and
have been updating from time to time since then, starting with kernel
2.6.38, the first one to handle the intel graphics properly on the
E6410. On F15 Alpha then Beta the intel graphic card worked perfectly
and still does, both with and without an external monitor or display.
<p>
On 24th May 2011, I started using the "final" Fedora 15 release. This introduced some
new problems.
<small>
<pre>
    I chose the FXCE version of Fedora 15, which I set up to boot in text mode
    (multi-user, run-level 3). Previously this was done by editing the file
        /etc/inittab
    but now that Fedora uses 'systemd', a more complex and flexible mechanism is provided.
    <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd</a>
    <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd</a>

    I have the impression that not all the software available to Fedora users has
    been updated properly to deal with systemd. In particular 'system-config-services'
    no longer gives all the options it used to (e.g. specifying which services should
    be available in different modes). I hope that will catch up later.
</pre>
</small>

After logging in to a textual interface, which allows me occasionally to do
maintenance work, I then use the 'startx' command, which reads ~/.xinitrc, to
start up the graphical interface.
<p>
I now sometimes launch
<a href="openbox/">Openbox</a> as window manager, though
occasionally experiment with others. The window manager I like best is
<a href="http://ctwm.free.lp.se/">ctwm,</a>, though it is not regularly
maintained.
<br/>
<b>NOTE: 5 Jan 2012</b>: Ctwm was updated to version 3.8.1 in January
2012. That works very well on both my laptop and my desktop machines, so
I have given up Openbox, except for occasional comparisons or tests.
<p>
An example ctwm window on a 1920x1080 screen is shown
<a href="ctwm/ctwm-full-screen.jpg">here</a>.
<p>
I intensely dislike Gnome and KDE as they make it
very difficult for me to set up all my preferred features, or to copy
them from one machine to another, because preferences are scattered all
over the place in different files.)

For several years I have been copying an old entry in /etc/fstab

fstab is required any more for cdrom as the insertion of a CD is
automatically detected. However, when I removed the entry the insertion
of a CD was not automatically detected.
<p>
As root I was able to mount the CD by creating /mnt/cdrom and giving the
command
<pre>
    mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
</pre>
But I wanted to be able to do it without using sudo or 'su'. Putting
myself in the 'cdrom' file access group made no difference. After
experimenting I found I could mount and unmount a CD using this line in
/etc/fstab

<pre>
    ## device    mount point  mount type    mount mode
    /dev/cdrom   /mnt/cdrom   auto          exec,users,noauto  0  0

Update 19 Aug 2011 Converted old Desk-top PC to use Edimax USB dongle
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
When I got a new desktop PC for my study (working perfectly with roughly
the same linux configuration as my laptop, as described below --
currently Fedora 15), I decided to try setting up my 6 year old PC as a
spare connected by wireless in another room. I found that the amazingly
cheap (and tiny) Edimax EW7711UTN USB dongle, with Ralink RT2870
wireless chip, worked fine for the purpose, though the wireless speed is
somewhat slower than my E6410 with intel wireless card, possibly because
that has an internal antenna in the laptop lid. (In fact both wireless
speeds increased significantly after I re-set my Dlink DIR-615 router to
use security mode "AUTO(TKIP/AES) rather than simply "TKIP".
<p>
At first I thought I was going to have to fetch source code and compile
Ralink drivers, but it turned out that fedora had a pre-built rpm.
<pre>
    rt3070-2.3.0.4-3.fc15.noarch

So installing it was just 'yum install rt3070', and then after rebooting
the device was recognized. The output of 'lsmod' includes:
<pre>

The usual information about my wireless router in

Shrinking Windows Partition -- using Partition Wizard
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
When the new Viglen PC arrived the windows 7 system had been installed
with one C: partition taking up the whole 500GB drive, instead of only
40GB as requested when I placed the order. (I can't imagine why Viglen
have that default: it's asking for trouble -- corrupt one partition
and you've lost everything).
<br/>
I tried using the 'shrink partition' facility that came with Win7 but
all it could do was shrink the partition to half its size: useless to me
because I hardly ever use windows and I wanted most of the drive for
linux.
<p>
After failing to find any way to make progress I found this review of
the free Partition Wizard software:
<br/>
<small>
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Partition-Wizard-Home-Edition/3000-2094_4-10962200.html">http://download.cnet.com/Partition-Wizard-Home-Edition/3000-2094_4-10962200.html</a>
</small>
<br/>
and decided to try it. It worked very well except that the user
interface needs a lot of improving. I asked it to shrink the C:
partition, then create a new smaller windows partition and call it the
E: partition.
<p>
After shrinking the C: partition it appeared to reboot, then displayed a
message on the screen that gave me the impression that it was still
doing the rest of the task. A long time later I guessed that it need to
be manually rebooted and tried. To my relief the partition had been
reduced as requested and I could give my remaining two instructions and
finish off the job. It should have warned me that I should not chain
additional instructions after shrinking a partition containing the file
downloaded to do the partition management. This may have been obvious to
windows users, but I am not a windows user. After that I installed
Fedora 15 and recreated my previous environment, on another machine that
I hope will last many years. (Viglen provide a 5 year maintenance
contract.)
<p>
The fact that microsoft cannot provide such a service in their partition
shrinking utility in Win7 is yet another piece of evidence that they are
incompetent. Several of my reasons for disliking MS Windows are here:

</small>
<p>
I later found that my complaint posted to MiniTools, the developers of
Partition Wizard when I was waiting for a response had been answered in
a couple of hours, instructing me to reboot and continue. But I did not
get the message until much later thanks to the dreadful VirginMedia
cable broadband service breakdown between about 1am Saturday 13th August
and midday on Wednesday 17th August. I have no apology and no refund
from them. I shall look out for a better internet service provider,
after 10 years of steadily increasing speed and deteriorating service,
with a call centre full of untrained staff. I no longer advise anyone to
use VirginMedia.

<b>2 Sep 2011 (problem still exists March 2012) Resume
after pm-hibernate:
problem and temporary solution</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
I've been finding with kernel 2.6.40-4 (and later, including 3.3.0-4.fc16.i686, March
2012) that if I hibernate and resume more than once, resume intermittently fails to
complete and instead reboots.

For some time I used TWO menu options in my grub.conf or grub.cfg file, one, labelled
'BOOT, for use when doing a full boot, and one labelled 'RESUME, the default option,
for use when booting from a hibernated state. The latter included acpi=off as a
kernel option.

However, I've discovered (30 Mar 2012) that acpi=noirq is better: it seems to prevent
resume failing in test kernel 3.3.0-7.1.fc16.i686, and does not require separate BOOT
and RESUME entries in the grub boot menu. I'll go on testing it and report details in
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=806315">this bug report</a>

I have no idea what that extra command does nor why it should suddenly become
necessary in recent kernels. Suggestions welcome.

<h3><b>
Update 18 Jun 2011: Hibernate and Tuxonice problems using Fedora 15 on Dell E6410
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>
I normally hardly ever reboot, making use of hibernate/resume instead, so that my
working context (including up to 10 virtual desktops) is always restored when I
switch on the computer.

The hibernate mechanism saves the state of the linux process in the swap partition
during hibernation, and then reads the contents and restores the full context during
the resume process. On my vintage 2006 desktop PC with a Western Digital 1TB drive
bought in 2010 the resume is extremely fast even when there are many windows in use
in my 10 virtual desktops. Since kernel 3.3 it is also very much faster on the Dell
E6410 laptop. So resuming from hibernate is much faster than rebooting, and far more
convenient than rebooting+restoring my working environment.

The hibernate mechanism contrasts with the 'suspend' mechanism, which switches
everything off except RAM, keeping the state of the process preserved and ready to
run. On a laptop the battery (or batteries) may survive for several days in this
state without external power. In contrast when hibernate (suspend to hard drive) is
used, everything is switched off and the state can be preserved indefinitely.
Suspend+resume is very much faster than hibernate+resume though after suspend the
battery will slowly drain if power is not left connected. I also found that on the
laptop if I alternate between hibernate and suspend (e.g. using hibernate for long
periods off, and suspend for short periods off), then suspend sometimes fails to
resume and I have to reboot.

Two forms of 'hibernate' are provided in linux. One (pm-hibernate) uses default
mechanisms provided in the standard linux kernel. The other method replaces the
default hibernate mechanisms with the the 'tuxonice' mechanism (previously known as
"Software Suspend 2"), as described here: <a href="http://tuxonice.net/">http://tuxonice.net/</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tuxonice">here, for Arch users.</a>
For several years, I have been a satisfied user of the pre-built tuxonice kernels for
Fedora, and associated utilities, made available here <a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">here,</a> by Matthias Hensler.

After trying the default hibernate mechanism provided in the linux kernel, invoked by
the 'pm-hibernate' command, I switched to tuxonice, with its 'hibernate' command,
because it has several advantages, including (a) speed, and especially (b)
informative display during hibernate and resume, and (c) displaying the grub boot
menu during resume.

In contrast, the pm-hibernate command (until about March 2012 in Fedora 16) causes
the machine to by-pass the boot menu on resume (until kernel 2.6.40-4), in case a
user boots the wrong linux kernel, which can lead to loss of work and potential
file-system corruption. Unfortunately this restrictive design of pm-hibernate makes
it impossible to hibernate linux, then boot windows, then later resume linux: you
don't get the choice. This is a terrible, patronising design decision by the
developers. They should at least offer a flag to use with pm-hibernate to make it
show the boot menu on resume.

In recent versions of Fedora 16, the behaviour of pm-hibernate has been improved: it
now always shows the boot menu if "hiddenmenu" is removed or commented out.

Fortunately the tuxonice 'hibernate' script (installed using

    'yum install hibernate-tuxonice'

does not have that restriction, and can also be used with the standard hibernate
mechanism. So after switching to Fedora 15, when there was no readily available
tuxonice version, I used the default hibernate mechanism invoked using the hibernate
script. This overcame the main flaw of pm-hibernate, namely hiding the grub menu.

When a tuxonice kernel for Fedora 15 finally became available, I immediately tried
it, and also tried each new version as it became available. So far I have been able
to get the tuxonice kernel to hibernate, but not to resume! The resume process
starts, indicates that it has begun unpacking the compressed image file, and then
freezes. It's possible that this is fixed in kernel 3.3, but I no longer use
tuxonice, so cannot tell. pm-hibernate has improved so much in the last year that the
advantages of tuxonice are not worth the extra effort (for me). However I miss the
'-r' flag in tuxonice hibernate, which allows hibernate to be followed by reboot,
which is useful for testing and for switching between operating systems.

<b>NOTE ADDED 7 Apr 2011--SWAP Partition and hibernate:</b>
<br/>
I have recently found that after a kernel upgrade hibernate (suspend to disc) does not always
work. The suspend appears to work, but resuming fails and linux reboots.
<br/>
A cure that works for me is to renew the swap partition after a kernel upgrade.
As root (assuming swap is /dev/sda3):
<small>
<pre>
    swapoff /dev/sda3
        if this fails you may have to go into maintenance mode, at run-level 1:
        'init 1'
        then repeat the above command.

    mkswap /dev/sda3

    swapon /dev/sda3

then continue as normal. e.g. 'init 5' for graphical login, or 'init  3' for text login.

Also make sure that the entry for swap in /etc/fstab does not reference some out of date partition ID.

<b>19 Mar 2011 -- Fedora 15 Alpha (with 32-bit 2.6.38.1 kernel) working
well on Dell Latitude E6410</b>

<blockquote>
Temporary summary -- to be revised.
<br/>
I started using Fedora 15 (F15, FC15) Alpha release, soon after I noticed that
it was available, on 15th March 2011.
<br/>
I now (20th March) have a very usable version of Fedora. Updates are <a href="#f15Alpha">above.</a>
<p>
At last there's a version of Fedora that works properly with the new intel
graphic card on Dell Latitude E6410.
<br/>
(I use 32-bit Fedora -- I don't know
about 64-bit Fedora).
<br/>
Apart from sorely missing tuxonice and its hibernate script I seem to be back
to my previous Fedora 13 functionality with missing bits fixed: SD card reader
now works, and lxrandr gives full control of resolution and external monitor.
Even the built-in microphone now works for the first time.
<p>
And within a few days of the Alpha release the F15 repositories had a wide
variety of updates and application packages -- e.g. vlc, gmplayer, amarok, and
others.
<p>
The configuration of my machine is given.
<a href="#config">above.</a>
<br/>
<blockquote>
<small>
<pre>
The Fedora 15 web site <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-prerelease">http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-prerelease</a> offers several different "Live media"
"spins" as downloadable CD iso images, in addition to the full distributions on DVDs.

I chose the F15 Lxde Fedora live CD to download, because I wanted the system to boot
as quickly as possible. The kernel provided was 2.6.38 (almost immediately updated to
2.6.38.1, which fixed several problems).

To start an installation while the live CD is running, click on the 'install' icon,
and follow instructions -- familiar from previous Fedora releases.

Although I managed to get the version I wanted installed using the Fedora+lxde live
CD I don't recommend it for anyone wishing to try out Fedora15. It may be best to try
the gnome or kde live CDs. I have seen a glowing test report on the live gnome CD.

However I don't like either Gnome or KDE for everyday use, for reasons explained
<a href="linux-desk-top-environments.html">here</a>, though I dislike Microsoft Windows even more, as explained <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/windows-hates.html"> here</a>!
</pre>
<b>Using the LXDE 'live' CD to install Fedora 15 on the Dell E6410</b>
<pre>
The lxde 'spin' proved not to be usable as a live CD (at least not on my machine). In
particular, terminal responses in lxterminal windows were terrible, with random
echoing of what I typed! I never found out why.

However, after installing F15 from that CD, with a cable network connection providing
30Mb/s I used 'yum update' to bootstrap to a much better version, including a new
kernel and some new drivers, which worked very well:

    2.6.38-1.fc15.i686 #1 SMP Tue Mar 15 05:26:56 UTC 2011

Since then, I have found updates appearing frequently in the Fedora 15 repos. I
started on 15th March and a few days later the system was very usable, with a large
and growing collection of packages in the official and unofficial fedora repos.

<b>Update: 22 Mar 2011</b> As explained below, although a tuxonice kernel is not yet
packaged for this system, the tuxonice hibernate script can be downloaded and works
perfectly, so far: a much better 'front end' than the terribly restrictive
pm-hibernate.
</pre>
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>From initial install of Fedora 15 + lxde to working system</b>
<blockquote>
After the initial installation to hard drive, providing kernel 2.6.38, I found
problems with the intel graphics, and had to use 'nomodeset' at boot to log in
and then run 'yum update' in an xterminal window (as root) to get a new version
of the kernel. That installed:
<pre>
    2.6.38-1.fc15.i686 #1 SMP Tue Mar 15 05:26:56 UTC 2011
</pre>
along with a lot of driver updates. That made a huge difference and the system
was usable.
<p>
(I had a problem at first after the update, because using the "nomodeset" boot
option earlier had put a temporary file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf invoking the
'vesa' graphic driver, and I had forgotten to remove it before testing the new
kernel. I managed to remove it using the Arch Linux CD as a rescue CD.)
<p>
I also produced an unusable system later by mistakenly including the fedora
Rawhide repo when using the package manager 'Yumex' to add things to the
system. That caused some early release Fedora 16 packages to be installed, and
they screwed up other F15 things. So I went back to an earlier stage, and used
only the standard Fedora repositories and the Atrpms and Rpm-fusion
repositories.
<p>
Together they have enabled me to build a well configured system including
multimedia tools (e.g. gmplayer, amarok, vlc, skype all working).
<p>
After the first update, fixing the kernel and various drivers, I could boot up
in full graphic mode, and the system has steadily got better and more complete
since then.
<p>
Instead of OpenOffice there is now Libreoffice, with similar functionality,
except that it seems to start up much faster.
<p>
The default version of Firefox on Fedora 15 is now V4.0. Google-chrome is also
available via the google repo. Firefox is now much improved (not so bulky and
slow) and it may reverse my move towards google-chrome, which lacks important
functionality that firefox has.
<small>
<pre>
    In fact, because FF 4 is so good, and because the default firefox for fedora 13,
    still running on my desktop PC is version 3.6.15, I fetched the tar file for
    firefox 4 installed it (no compiling needed) and now it runs on the desktop
    too.
</pre>
</small>
<p>
As usual, after trying NetworkManager I found it too irritating and
unpredictable shut it down, and installed wicd instead. Wifi and ethernet
connections now work fine.
<p>
My t-mobile "pay as you go" mobile broadband USB dongle (with Huawei
technology) works <a href="huawei-220-linux.html">as before</a> as before
using wvdial. There may also be a graphical interface tool for it, but I
have shell commands that suffice.
<p>
<b>Fedora 15: /etc/inittab is now defunct</b>
<blockquote>
On linux, I normally alter the default run-level to 3 in /etc/inittab --
non-graphical multi-user mode, with text-only login. I can then run 'startx' to
go into graphical mode, controlled by my ~/.xinitrc file and ~/.config/openbox
files for the windowmanager.
<br/>
However things have changed and the 'inittab' file recommends altering the
default.target link in the system directory in /lib/systemd/. But that did not
work for me: I still got the graphical login.
<br/>
However adding the parameter '3' at the end of the grub boot command works, and
has the advantage that it can be modified at boot time if needed.

Lots of things produce 'dell_wmi: Received unknown WMI event (0x11)'

<br>
Screen works perfectly, and the SD card reader works.
Even the built in microphone, and scrolling on the alps
touch pad now work.

<b>Keeping old versions of linux available</b>
<br/>
When I installed F15, I used a new partition for root, but reused old /boot,
/home /usr/local and swap partitions. After the installation, I restored
previously saved old boot images to /boot and reinserted some old bits of
/boot/grub/grub.conf so that I could still boot previous versions of linux in
addition to the new version.
<br/>
I kept an older mostly working fedora 13, windows 7 (used very rarely), and
Arch linux used experimentally.
<br/>
(Re-using boot and preserving previous installations can be tricky
There are probably how-to guides online.)
<p>
<b>Sound using Pulseaudio</b>
<br/>
I had previously found that starting in non-graphical mode and then entering
graphical mode did not provide sound by default, and pulseaudio had to be
started by an explicit command. In Fedora 15 the command is:
<pre>
    pulseaudio --start
</pre>
e.g. in the ~/.xinitrc file, or openbox autostart.sh file.
<p>
<b>Allowing logins using SSH (and file copy, etc.)</b>
<br/>
At first I could not log in to F15 from other machines at home. Eventually I
discovered this was because the iptables firewall is set by default to prevent
anything connecting via 'ssh' or anything else. Starting sshd should fix that
but does not. To fix the firewall I had to run system-config-firewall-tui and
choose 'customise' to enable ssh logins. Alternatively, you can edit
/etc/sysconfig/iptables, and add this rule, before the first line containing
'REJECT'.
<pre>
     -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
<p>
<b>19 Mar 2011 - TEMPORARY PROBLEMS WITH F15 Alpha:</b>
<br/>
After the above-mentioned upgrades everything was working well, and I could use
pm-hibernate to suspend to hard drive and resume later.
<br/>
However, when I later tried a full reboot, it had acquired very annoying
behaviour: close to finishing rebooting it would hang,
for about 6 or 7 minutes,
then continue and complete the boot process - after which things were normal.
<br>
The behaviour was the same for graphical and  non-graphical boot.
It seemed to hang after the partitions listed in /etc/fstab are mounted.
<p>
While booting was stalled there was no sign of hard drive activity, but the
wireless lamp came on and flashed, and the Dlink wireless router, indicated
that a connection was being made, but not completed  -- e.g. I could not log in
remotely. I also could not use CTRL+ALT+F2 to switch to a console terminal
during the freeze. But several minutes later the  boot completed and everything
worked normallyl.
<br>
After a couple of hours puzzling about this I found that the pause had
disappeared -- perhaps a result of running "yum update" to get the
latest updates.
<br/>
I really don't understand what caused it or what removed it. If it was a
temporary bug it should not affect others but I mention it in case
someone finds that booting hangs. Wait 5 to 10 minutes to see if it then
completes. In that case do a full 'yum update', as I did. F15 Alpha
worked well for me, until the final F15 became available.
<p>
However, now that I have found a way to boot in non-graphical mode, by
putting '3' at the end of the boot command line in /boot/grub/grub.conf I have
not tried booting directly in graphical mode, so I can't confirm that that
works. I don't like booting straight into graphical mode.
<br/>
[UPDATE 31 Aug 2011: A couple of weeks ago I bought a new PC to replace
my old and sometimes unreliable one, and have been using F15 on it,
installed from the "XFCE Light" CDROM.
Everything works fine, though because it's a very fast machine I have
not bothered to disable the graphical boot: it starts with the login
chooser, and I run Openbox. I then use hibernate and resume instead of
shutdown and reboot.]
<p>
<b>Tuxonice not yet available in F15 repositories</b>
<br/>
I look forward to having tuxonice with its hibernate command provided in
pre-built kernels. It is better than the default suspend to disc (using
pm-hibernate) in several ways:
<ul>
<li>
Tuxonice seems to resume faster.
<li>
It provides a nice display showing progress (using plain text graphics). This
can be useful as a diagnostic aid if anything goes wrong.
<li>
The hibernate script pays attention to config files that allow the user to set
various options (e.g. specifying actions before and after hibernating).
<li>
<pre>
Very importantly, tuxonice resume from suspend lets you see the boot menu,
whereas pm-hibernate does not, presumably on the assumption that booting any
other installed version of linux after a suspend can corrupt files.

But that feature of pm-hibernate also stops me switching conveniently between linux
and windows (occasionally needed to test something).

The arrogant linux developers rule this out in pm-hibernate because the dangers
of misuse (accidentally booting a different version of linux from the one
suspended in the swap area) can be serious. I have done this once or twice and
with ext3 or ext4 file systems this has proved no more serious than crashing
because of a power failure.
"pm-hibernate" should be provided with a documented option to allow the
boot menu before resume, along with dire warnings about booting the wrong
system.

Otherwise linux will only be of use for amateurs escaping from Windows.

Using tuxonice, I can now use 'hibernate' to save the state of my linux system,
including multiple desktops with unfinished work, then boot into windows if I
need to, then shutdown windows and the result linux restoring everything very
quickly. This mechanism could also be used to switch between two installed
versions of linux if they use different swap partitions. However pm-hibernate
makes this impossible, which is very annoying. I could try to build a tuxonice
kernel, but prefer to wait until experts have provided one.
</pre>

<b>21 Mar 2011: Hibernate problem solved</b>
<br/>
I fetched the latest hibernate tar.gz file from here:
<a href="http://tuxonice.net/">http://tuxonice.net/</a>
<br>
Currently:
<a href="http://tuxonice.net/files/hibernate-script-2.0.tar.gz">http://tuxonice.net/files/hibernate-script-2.0.tar.gz</a>
<pre>
This proved very simple to install using the script provided. So far it seems to work
perfectly, and unlike 'pm-hibernate' does not make the boot menu inaccessible on
resume. So I have a system nearly as good as tuxonice now. I think it is a little
slower to resume than tuxonice, but will not be able to compare until I have a
tuxonice kernel to try out.
</pre>
</ul>
<b>ADDED 21 May 2011:
<br/>
Using 'preupgrade', installed Fedora 15 on my Desktop PC after trying on laptop</b>
<pre>
I decided to upgrade my desktop PC (running Fedora 13) to Fedora 15, so as not to
have different versions on the PC and Laptop.

For the first time ever I used the fedora 'preupgrade' package that analysed my
installation and created information about requirements to upgrade. It gave me the
option to skip the upgrade to F14 and go straight to F15. It provides all the information
required to upgrade and alters /boot/grub.conf to give you the option to boot into
the upgrade process when you next reboot. It saves the hassle of downloading a
bootable image, though you need to make sure you have everything backed up.

It mostly worked, but because I had previously been using an encrypted root partition
it failed. It asked me for the password, but seemed to be unable to use it. I have
not understood why: normally Fedora systems simply request the password then decrypt
the partition. In this case it requested the password, but failed. So I decided to
run with root on an unencrypted partition. (Not ideal, since the '/etc' directory
includes some unencrypted potentially sensitive information.)

Since it is not possible to decrypt a partition in 'situ' I rebooted to a working linux,
then created a new partition (the hard drive had plenty of spare space), copied the
contents of the old root partition to the new one (using 'cp -au'), altered grub and
/etc/fstab in the new partition to look for the the new root, and then rebooted.j

It worked after a glitch that stopped some things running, because when I created the
new root partition I had been logged in as a temporary user, and I forgot to make
root the owner of the root partition! (It took some time to track down the cause of
the symptoms.)

For some reason this installation of F15 does not create or update the
/var/log/messages file. I have not been able to understand why. However I can run
'dmesg' from time to time and save the output.

For a while I tried using Gnome and then KDE on this machine running Fedora 15, and
disliked both, as explained <a href="linux-desk-top-environments.html">here.</a>
</pre>
<a name="arch"></a>
<hr/>
<b>Summary: Fedora vs Arch</b>
<pre>
As explained <a href="#arch-37">below</a>, I tried using Arch, and was impressed, especially
by its Live CD which boots quickly into console mode, making it an ideal rescue CD.
It also got my screen and internal SD card reader working, and provided a very
convenient and quick update mechanism.

However I found that there does not seem to be as big a community supporting it, so
many of the things I wanted were not available unless I fetched the source from the
Arch user repository and compiled it. That worked for a couple of things I tried, but
was very tedious, and I could not get tuxonice to work that way. In contrast, very
soon after the Alpha release of Fedora 15 (about 5 days) I had a full working system,
except for the tuxonice kernel, which I assume will be available eventually prebuilt
for Fedora users, as in the past.

So my conclusion is that Arch is only for adventurous people who want total control,
or people who want a very lightweight minimal linux system.

<h3><b>
ORIGINAL SUMMARY OF REACTIONS TO E6410 (JUNE 2010)
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Overall this is the best laptop I have ever used. Even the speakers sound
surprisingly good despite the machine being small and thin (compared with my previous
laptop: Dell D610). Of course bass is lacking. But a classical music channel playing
on Amarok while I am working is quite tolerable most of the time -- and even better
with earphones, of course!

The screen is much brighter in daylight than previous screens. I regret the fact that
the vertical resolution is now only 900,  but I am coping -- though it needs extra
scrolling when reading or writing documents.

Unfortunately linux support for the intel graphic card has been deficient, though I
found a specific Fedora 13 kernel that does almost all I need, as described <a href="#f13-intel">here,</a>
except for not supporting the integrated SD card reader, and requiring special care
when using an external monitor or projector. Since Fedora 15, both the SD card reader
and external displays work perfectly.

The keyboard feels excellent, and the backlighting is a very useful option. The Alps
touch-pad works well,  including supporting vertical scrolling, since It's superb to
have middle mouse key on a laptop at last -- I use it all the time for inserting
previously selected text, and am very pleased that I no longer have to emulate middle
key by pressing left and right simultaneously -- this previously drove me to use a
USB mouse, which I no longer need.

The intel wireless card is very well supported on linux. I disabled NetworkManager,
and wicd provides excellent wireless service.
(Note: 8 Sep 2012: I have reinstated NM for a trial period on Fedora 17, since Wicd
seems to have stopped working in F17.)

<b>13 Feb 2011: Virginmedia superhub is junk</b>
Using new VirginMedia (Netgear) Superhub with download speed increased to 30mb/s I
found I had frequent time-outs when using SSH. Problem description and solution <a href="http://community.virginmedia.com/t5/Up-to-50Mb-broadband/Frequent-disconnects-on-new-superhub-if-I-pause-while-logged/td-p/333445">here.</a>
I shall add more information on use of the Superhub <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/virgin-media-superhub.html">here.</a>

<b>Summary: The Virgin Media Superhub is Junk except for a small subset of users.</b>
It attempts to integrate cable modem and cable/wireless router in one device, but the
design specification for the package was so dreadful that whoever led that project is
clearly incompetent and should be sacked.

The design flaws, fiercely criticised on the User forum, have been recognised and new
firmware allowing the Superhub to be used as a fast cable modem connected to a
separate router is promised in May 2011. I managed to partially convert it and now
use it with my Dlink DIR-615 router (provided by Virgin Media over a year ago).

Before that I discovered that although the superhub wireless mechanism
works for a laptop in the same room or immediately below, its power was
grossly inadequate for our medium sized 2-storey house, and it failed to
connect anywhere outside the central half of the house. In contrast the
Dlink reaches my laptop in all the far corners of the house, and outside
at the back. Several other people on the user forum also reported
grossly inadequate wireless functionality in the Superhub.

Virgin Media are still advertising the Superhub as a wonderful new combined
Cable Model and wireless router. They are lying to the public and should be
exposed.

<b>25 Feb 2011: Excellent Dell Repair Service -- brief report</b>
On Wednesday 23rd I dropped my laptop, bending the base. It was switched on,
running linux. at first the wireless connection stopped and would not restart,
until I rebooted.

Thursday, after many tests to ensure that nothing was wrong except for external
damage, I phoned Dell support, as I had 3-year accidental damage cover. I was asked
for my express service code and routed to an expert, who asked me a lot of questions,
then asked me to take a lot of photographs and send them in. I also mentioned a
previously cracked lid, and a fiddly catch on DVD drive. They confirmed that this
could be repaired on site and scheduled a repair visit.

On Friday morning the Dell technician phoned and said he would come between 11 and
1pm. Just before 12, he arrived, disassembled the laptop, replaced base plate and lid
and DVD drive, reassembled everything, waited for me to do a few tests, and left
shortly after 1pm.

<b>Everything seems to be working perfectly, and I have the impression the speakers
sound better than previously. I am very impressed. No talking to someone ignorant at
a foreign Dell call centre as in the distant past.

I guess it's also a tribute to the E6410 design and manufacture that falling from a
table to a hard floor damaged only the outer case. It was running linux at the time,
so could not have been protected by Dell's anti shock protection mechanism, which as
far as I know works only in Windows.</b>

<b>Update: 23 Mar 2011</b>
A few days ago I found that one of the two screws holding the hard drive in place had
come out. I reported this by email and very quickly had a bag of screws delivered by
courier. More excellent Dell service.

DELL LATITUDE E6410, DELIVERED 4TH JUNE 2010

<blockquote>
<b>Pictures and some reviews</b>

(mostly windows users, however).

<pre>
A partial review of the E6410 as a machine to run linux is below.

<b>Intel vs Nvidia Graphics?</b>
I chose the Intel HD Graphics (with Express Card) option, not NVidia. I am happy
with this, as regards performance and power consumption.

At first the linux software support for this card was seriously deficient. For a
while I used a version of fedora 13 with which I could do everything I want as long
as I don't have an external monitor connected when the machine goes in and out of
graphic mode. That version is described <a href="#f13-intel">below.</a>

But when I tried to use  more recent kernel (up to 2.6.36 on Fedora 14) there were
problems with the display, whether at boot time, or if the screensaver blanks the
display, after which it cannot be restored.

So for a while I stuck with the F13 kernel from June 2010. The only disadvantage of
going back to F13 was that I can't use the built in SD card reader, which requires a
later kernel. So I have to mount such cards in a USB SD cardholder. Also I have to
disconnect any external display before switching in or out of graphic mode. But all
that has been fixed in Fedora 15.

<b>NOTE:</b> I have found that with 32-bit 2.6.37 Arch Linux kernel the Intel
graphics functionality is perfect (though apparently only 2.6.38 works with this
Intel graphics running 64-bit linux). I have not switched to Arch because too many
other things that I have working on Fedora seem to be much more fiddly to set up in
Arch (e.g. tuxonice for hibernate).

<hr/>
People trying to use the E6410+Nvidia graphics with linux may find <a href="http://www.spinics.net/linux/fedora/fedora-users/msg380813.html">this web site</a>
useful. Nvidia graphics also seem to be causing problems for Linux+E6410 machines.
(I don't know if the problems have been solved yet. The intel graphics problems have,
since about march 2011 e.g. in Fedora 15).

<b>Added 2 Feb 2011:</b>

<br/>
Machine Details summarised <a href="#config">above.</a>
<br/>
Graphics on Fedora was OK only on an older Fedora 13 (fc13) kernel
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Using the 1440x900 graphic display with intel HD graphic card was found to be
problematic until I installed the Fedora15 Alpha Release in March 2011, using
this kernel
<pre>
    2.6.38-1.fc15.i686 #1 SMP Tue Mar 15 05:26:56 UTC 2011
</pre>
(installed by "yum update" soon after installation of FC15).
<p>
I found no earlier versions of the linux kernel (on Fedora or Arch or
Ubuntu) that worked properly with this intel graphic card.
<p>
<b>Partial solution, using Fedora 13</b>
<br/>
For a time, I used a partial solution that
works on (32-bit) Fedora 13, but only with the hard to find 2.6.33.5-112_1
kernel -- with tuxonice (software suspend 2).
<p>
Just in case someone is unable to upgrade to Fedora 15, I provide details for
getting this machine to work on Fedora 13 with this kernel:

    2.6.33.5-112_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc13.i686

until there is a proper long term fix.
</blockquote>
This works with modesetting turned on at boot time (using the
default or "i915.modeset=1" in the boot command or perhaps just
"modeset", or even no command specifying mode. (Not sure.)
<p>
In addition you need to have the Xorg 'intel' driver, and make sure
that your file /etc/X11/xorg.conf mentions the intel driver for
video, not 'vesa' or 'psb'.
<p>
This solution is imperfect for three reasons:
<br/>
(1) I have to make sure
that no external display (monitor or projector) is connected when
switching in and out of graphic mode -- otherwise it crashes.
<p>
(2) Using lxrandr I can select only the default screen
resolution 1440x900, instead of the lower resolutions of which the
display is capable.
<p>
(3)
Using fedora 13 I can't use the Ricoh SDHC card reader built into
the laptop,  so I have to use an external usb adapter for SD cards,
which is a nuisance.
<p>
I was able to live with those constraints between June 2010 and March 2011,
when FC15 Alpha became available, removing the constraints.
<hr/>
<p>
<b>Other F13 and F14 pre-built kernels don't work with Intel
graphics on E6410</b>
<br/>
With all other F13 or F14 kernels I could only get the laptop to start up OK
with nomodeset and the 'vesa' driver  specified in /etc/X11/xorg.conf,
which made using an external monitor or projector impossible.

NOTE added 2 Feb 2011 (Arch Linux 2.6.37, 32 bit on Dell E6410); Updated 9 Feb; 13 Feb 2011
</b></h3>
My display partly worked with a 2.6.36 kernel on Arch linux, but
getting it to boot with the display working as desired was not
reliable, and there were problems after hibernate/resume or
screenblank.
<p>
Following a suggestion by Jeremy LaCroix
(<a href="http://www.jlacroix.me">http://www.jlacroix.me</a>) who has
almost the same hardware configuration on his E6410 but uses a
different wireless card and runs 64-bit linux, I tried Arch linux
with the 2.6.37 kernel (32 bit) and things seem to be better,
especially with recent software updates.
<pre>
    %uname -rv
    2.6.37-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Jan 29 19:40:04 UTC 2011
</pre>
<p>
On my machine the display now starts up perfectly with that kernel.
It also works after screen blank, and after pm-suspend/resume. (That
includes restoring previous WPA wireless connection.)
<br/>
At first pm-hibernate did not work at all: after hibernate: it
re-booted instead of resuming. This was fixed as described
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=73848">here.</a>
<pre>
    In
        /boot/grub/menu.lst

    add after root=/dev/sda14 in the boot specification:

        resume=/dev/sda3

    In the file /etc/mkinitcpio.conf add "resume" to this line:

        HOOKS="base udev autodetect scsi sata resume filesystems"

    Then run this command as root:

         mkinitcpio -p kernel26
</pre>
Now pm-hibernate works on Arch.
<p>
Early problems after hibernate, with
the display,
and use of mouse or touch-pad after hibernate, have disappeared
since an Arch update on (9 Feb 2011).
<p>
So it looks as if 2.6.37 is mostly usable running Arch on my 32-bit machine.
<br/>
However, I now use 2.6.38-1 on Fedora 15.
<p>
<p>
If I can find a way to get tuxonice and other things I use working with Arch I
may switch to using it at some future date. Meanwhile I prefer Fedora as so
many things I can easily install on Fedora (or Ubuntu) are much more hassle to
find and install on Arch. (E.g. kernel-tuxonice).
<a name="xubuntu"></a>
<p>
<b>NOTE: 5 Feb 2011 -- Testing Xubuntu light with 2.6.38, on
Dell Latitude E6410</b>
<br/>
I fetched the latest 32 bit Xubuntu (Natty alpha 2) "live CD" to
try out. It uses a 2.6.38 kernel.
<br/>
I chose Xubuntu as that was described as the most light-weight
version, which is what I always prefer.
<br/>
The Intel display worked fine, and I could connect an external
monitor and run 'xrandr --auto' to get it working. When I added
lxrandr I could also get the full range of display resolutions
available on the E6410, instead of only the default 1400x900. It
also worked with an external 1280x1024 monitor.
<br/>
Having got that far with the live CD, I created a partition in which
to install it, sharing the existing boot partition. For the initial
installation I had to use a cable connection as it did not give me
the option set up the connection to my wireless router using WPA.
<br/>
The Xubuntu installer followed my instruction to use the existing /boot
partition without reformatting it (I had saved a copy as a precaution). It
discovered the existing boot files and managed to edit my menu.lst file to
create a new grub.cfg file using syntax I had never seen before, for booting in
a variety of environments. It left my previous windows 7 and fedora 13 options,
and other experimental options available. That's impressive. Fedora has never
offered me that option (Correction: When Fedora 15 finally appeared, it
told it to use the pre-existing /boot partition without formatting. I
merged the new installation with old ones successfully.)
<p>
Also unlike Fedora Xubuntu sensibly makes the boot menu
visible on start up by default. Hiding it by default is completely daft when
there is more than one boot option (e.g. linux and Windows).
<br/>
I spent a little while trying XUbuntu using Openbox rather than the
other Desktop managers available. Most things worked though I did not
find out how to disable network-manager so that I could use wicd.
<br>
pm-suspend worked at first with Ubuntu, but after doing it twice I had trouble
re-connecting to the wireless network. Presumably that's a temporary problem. I
could not run pm-hibernate, as hibernate was not included in the alpha test
kernel.
<br/>
Xubuntu did not install as good a default set of X libraries as Arch
linux did (e.g. including libXt, libXext, libX11, and motif/or
lesstif).
<p>
For a while the debian x-terminal-emulator, which I had not
previously encountered, was the only replacement for xterm that
handled the xterm region-scrolling mechanisms properly: for example,
gnome-terminal, and lxterminal both failed.
<br/>
(Correction: lxterminal in
Arch running 2.6.37 and on Fedora 15 works OK as an Xterm emulator.)
<p>
<b>In Xubuntu+2.6.38 The Alps touch pad now has vertical scrolling working!</b>
<br/>
Not yet in Fedora 15, alas (2 Apr 2011).

but at first I found that plugging in an external monitor crashed
linux, though it worked OK with Windows 7. That was later fixed in Fedora 15.
<p>
Because I could not immediately use the 22" Dell monitor, I gave it
to my wife, to replace her 17" Samsung 1280x1024 monitor, used for
her work, which includes making orienteering maps, using OCAD.
<br/>
The Dell was much better for her work, so she kept it!
<p>
I then bought a cheaper, 22" monitor at Comet: LG
FLATRON W2253TQ (&pound;139.00).
<br/>
That has worked very
well since, with 1920x1080 resolution, which allows me to view two
PDF A4 documents side by side (or two pages of the same document).
<blockquote>
<small>
It has DVI and VGA input sockets, much better
switches on the panel, and a slightly higher spec (contrast and
response time) than the W2243S.
<br/>
Its performance is excellent and it has so far not gone wrong.
<br/>
The DVI input is connected to my desktop PC for normal use.
<br/>
The VGA input can be connected to the laptop when required, and the
'source'
button used to switch inputs.
<br/>
<b>A highly recommended monitor.</b>
</small>
</blockquote>
For now I mostly use the LG Monitor with my old desktop PC, though I
may later move to using mainly the laptop as it is more powerful.
<p>
However, while connected to the PC I can log through to the laptop
and use it across the network, very conveniently: a great benefit of
linux and the X window system.

<b>Fedora 13 Live CD works on the Dell Latitude E6410 with Intel Graphics</b>
<br/>
<blockquote>
Because of all the problems running this laptop in graphical mode
described I thought I would see whether it works using the
Fedora 13 Live CD Fedora-13-i686-Live.iso (about 700MB) which I had
downloaded from the Fedora web site on 27th May 2010.
<p>
<b>Result:</b> everything worked perfectly. It went into graphical
mode, allowed me to connect to a wireless network (using the
NetworkManager applet (though I normally use wicd instead), when I
ran firefox and tried to get the BBC News display working, it told
me I needed flash. So I followed the instructions, installed the
latest flash plugin, restarted firefox and BBC News worked
perfectly, even in full screen mode.
<p>
The volume control buttons on the laptop worked, though I am not
able to access them in my normal working mode (using CTWM or Openbox
instead of gnome).

<h3><b>
UPDATE 2 Jul 2010: Problem getting Pulseaudio working in
Runlevel 3 -- Solved at last
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
At various stages in the creation of this document (starting several
years ago when I had a Dell Latitude D610), I have noted problems
with pulseaudio. From the time it first appeared up to Fedora 12,
after trying to use it and failing, I found advice given on many
websites and removed pulseaudio, and anything that depended on it
completely, after which sound worked fine (based on ALSA).
<p>
When I installed and tested Fedora 13, initially using the default
graphical login process, at runlevel 5, I found, for the first time,
that sound worked perfectly, using pulseaudio, whether I tried audio
recordings, videos with sound, or sound and video on the web (e.g.
BBC iplayer). (I have had problems getting skype to work, unless I
run it as root. I don't know why.)
<p>
However I don't like booting into runlevel 5, and as in the past
changed /etc/inittab to boot into runlevel 3, after which I
use the console login process, and normally run startx to enter
graphical mode, with either CTWM or OpenBox as (light weight, but
flexible) window manager. I then usually don't log out again for
weeks: I simply use hibernate and resume (using the 'tuxonice'
suspend to disk mechanism).
<p>
Unfortunately I was not able to get pulseaudio to work in
that mode, and had to switch to runlevel 5 (using 'init 5' as
superuser) if I wanted to use sound.
<p>
This led me to the conclusion that I should once again have to
remove pulseaudio completely. However, comparing things
that were running at level 3 and at level 5 as shown by
<pre>
    ps auxww
</pre>
I started to experiment. Eventually I found what seems to be the
answer -- after noticing that gstreamer seems apparently involved.
<br/>
Install these packages

<pre>
    PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin-0.6.5-1.fc13.i686
    gstreamer-0.10.29-2.fc13.i686
    gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-0.10.19-1.fc13.i686
    gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10.29-1.fc13.i686
    gstreamer-plugins-good-0.10.23-1.fc13.i686
    gstreamer-python-0.10.16-1.fc12.i686
    gstreamer-tools-0.10.29-2.fc13.i686
    phonon-backend-gstreamer-4.4.2-1.fc13.i686
</pre>

(I am not sure they are all needed, but have not tried
experimenting to see which I can remove.)
<p>
And also make sure you have these two utilities:

<pre>
    /usr/bin/gnome-volume-control
    /usr/bin/gnome-sound-recorder
</pre>

These are included in the following, I think.
<pre>
    gnome-media-2.30.0-1.fc13.i686
    gnome-media-apps-2.30.0-1.fc13.i686
</pre>

Once all those are installed I find that after starting up graphic
mode in runlevel 3, I can run

<pre>
    /usr/bin/gnome-volume-control
</pre>

As soon as I adjust the output level, my speakers produce a 'plop'
and after that audio output works, though I have to experiment with
volume levels.
<p>
To ensure that you can record from microphone (after making sure the
mic plug is in the mic socket) run both of these

<pre>
    /usr/bin/gnome-volume-control
    /usr/bin/gnome-sound-recorder
</pre>

On the volume control panel, select the 'Input' tab, and experiment
with the 'Connector' menu options. I found "Analog
Microphone/Microphone 1" worked. The input recording level will
probably need to be adjusted. If it is too high all the sound
recorded will be badly distorted.
<p>
Use the 'sound recorder' to test microphone input. Click the red
button to start recording and watch the volume level at the bottom
as you talk. Click the square to stop. Click the triangle to play
the recording. You have the option to save your recordings as files.
<p>
It is quite likely that people who do not wish to use those two
gnome tools (which work without gnome running) will find some other
tools that are able to kick-start pulseaudio as gnome-volume-control
seems to do. I don't know the role of 'Packagekit' in all this. I
may have found a spurious correlation.
<p>
If anyone understands what is happening and writes or has written a
tutorial on this, please contact me. I would be happy to insert a
link.

<b>Problem with FC15 hibernate and wicd (Now fixed 24 Mar 2012)</b>
I have never found NetworkManager satisfactory, and use <a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">wicd</a>
to control network
connections instead. It provides more options than NM, and makes them far more easily
accessible at any time, and does not have to be accessed through a desktop applet.
<p>
However, a problem emerged after I installed Fedora 15. I found that the attempt to
hibernate would sometimes fail, with this report:
<small>
<pre>
    hibernate: [61] Executing WICDSuspend ...
    wicd directory not found, cannot signal Wicd
    hibernate: Aborting suspend due to errors in WICDSuspend (use --force to override).
</pre>
</small>

After hunting around I found that that report came from the wicd script here:
<small>
<pre>
    /usr/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d/wicd
</pre>
</small>
That wicd script searches for another script that is part of the wicd code, and it
was searching in the wrong place. The actual script looked for is here:
<small>
<pre>
    /usr/share/wicd/daemon/autoconnect.py
</pre>
</small>
whereas it was searching here:
<small>
<pre>
    /usr/share/wicd/autoconnect.py
</pre>
</small>
So I edited the wicd script by inserting 'daemon' in the directory name here:
<small>
<pre>
    WICDFindScripts() {
            for NAME in /usr/lib/wicd /usr/share/wicd/daemon; do
                    if [ -f "${NAME}/autoconnect.py" ]; then
                            WICD_DIR=${NAME}
                    fi
            done
    }
</pre>
</small>
That seems to work fine, and the hibernate command works.
<p>
The
default hibernate is actually quite tolerable when used with 'hibernate' rather than
'pm-hibernate'. I had to use 'yum' to install hibernate (which despite the name of
the package works fine without tuxonice):
<small>
<pre>
    yum install hibernate-tuxonice
</pre>
</small>
<p>
I assume the tuxonice bug will be fixed eventually. If so, I'll report that here.
I suspect the bug is also due to a change in the directory structure since Fedora 15
and kernel 2.6.38, caused by the switch from using init to using
systemd.

<h3><b>
SUMMARY:
Using the Dell latitude E6410 with intel graphics on linux (Fedora 13)
</b></h3>

<blockquote>
Overall, the E6410 is a very attractive and usable machine, though
quite heavy with 9-cell 90Whr battery. (See <a href="#weight">
weight information below.</a>)
<p>
As a linux user, apart from a hopefully temporary driver problem for
new intel graphics, with a temporary workaround, I am very pleased
with my choice of the E6410 (updated version of the Latitude E6400)
-- having considered other Dell models and also Sony, Lenovo
(Thinkpad)  and Toshiba.
<br/>
There may not be a comparable problem for users who choose the
NVidia driver.
<p>
All makes seem
to have moved over to the wide-screen low height format (e.g.
1440x900) which I dislike. I much prefer the 1440x1050 ratio on the
Dell D610. In most other respects the E6410 is much better.
<p>
<b>Warning: [Problem fixed in F15]</b>
The new Intel graphic card will work only with very
recent versions of linux. I had problems with Fedora 12, so switched
to Fedora 13. There were still problems attaching an external
monitor, as explained below, and older versions of linux may fail to
boot. E.g. the latest Knoppix live DVD, Version 6.2, seemed to be
unable to cope with the graphic card: it did not get as far as
producing any user prompt. For progress on open source drivers for
intel graphics see
<a href="http://intellinuxgraphics.org/">http://intellinuxgraphics.org/</a>
<br> There is a FAQ list here
<a href="http://intellinuxgraphics.org/documentation.html">http://intellinuxgraphics.org/documentation.html</a>
<p>
<b>Fedora 13:</b> is a mature linux distribution, with a large
collection of 'extra' packages available

<h3><b>
Benefits and problems: Dell Latitude E6410 on Fedora 13
</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Intel graphic card seems to have adequate performance</b>
<br/>
I had been a little concerned about the performance of the Intel
Graphics, but need not have worried.

<blockquote>
Running linux (Fedora 13), the performance of the new Intel graphics
on Dell Latitude E6410 is much better than
performance of the ATI Radeon M300 card on Dell Latitude D610
using the linux ati driver.
<p>
On the D610, the proprietary ATI driver gave problems with software
suspend/hibernate, and did not work with xrandr when I last tried
it. On windows both graphic cards work well, e.g. with BBC
iPlayer full screen mode.
<p>
On the E6410, the combination of intel graphic card and the linux
driver <b>mostly</b> gives excellent performance for my needs --
playing no computer games!
<p>
E.g. switching to full screen on BBC iPlayer is no longer jerky,
unlike full screen video on my desktop machine also running fedora
13, using an nvidia graphic card (GEforce 6200).
</blockquote>
Except for the number of pixels vertically, the E6410 screen
is the best I have had on a laptop, and usable in much brighter
light than my old D610.
<p>
However, I badly miss the larger sized 14" display with 1440x1050
pixels: 1440x900 is just too short top to bottom for some of the
work and reading I do -- and requires too much scrolling. This can
be mitigated by using an external display (like the Dell or LG 22"
monitors mentioned above) for extended work, though connecting an
external monitor when using current versions of linux (July 2010)
requires disconnecting the monitor when switching in or out of
graphic mode, as explained <a href="#monitor-problem">below.</a>
<p>
<li>
Using the new Intel graphic card
with an external monitor when booting into runlevel 5 (graphical
login) could crash the machine when running fedora 13, as described
<a href="#monitor-problem">below.</a>
<p>
<b>However this problem has been fixed since Fedora 15 and kernel 2.6.38.</b>
<p>
For a while I used the laptop successfully with this F13 kernel and xorg components:
<small>
<pre>
    2.6.33.5-124_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc13.i686 #1 SMP Tue Jun 22 14:49:14 CEST 2010

    xorg-x11-drv-intel-2.11.0-4.fc13.i686
    xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.8.0-17.fc13.i686
</pre>
</small>
<p>
<p>
<li>
<b>Sound and pulseaudio</b>
<br/>
Sound on the E6410 worked OK: after installing Fedora 13, time
pulseaudio just worked for most things (as long as I started up in
graphical mode, at runlevel 5), so I did not have to get rid of it
as in previous versions of Fedora.
<p>
When I first altered the boot configuration to start in runlevel 3, I found
after starting the window manager that pulseaudio no longer worked.
<br/>
However, I managed to get sound working on both my laptop and my
desktop machine running Fedora 13, and using pulseaudio, at runlevel
3, as described <a href="#pulse-solved">above.</a>
<p>
<li>
<b>Skype sound at first did not
not work properly with pulseaudio -- except at runlevel 5</b>
<br/>
For a while I was unable to get skype to work on the E6410 at
runlevel 3, which
is how I normally work.
<br/>
<b>Update 8 Sep 2012:</b> Skype works fine on Fedora, though for a while
I had trouble getting audio to work at run-level 3 (multi-user
non-graphical login). In my ~/.xinitrc file I have
<pre>
    pulseaudio --start
</pre>
and audio now generally works well by default.
<br>
I also had problems with the skype fonts being too small, but the
qtconfig-qt4 tool allows me to specicify font style and size, to make
things readable. It's important to click on 'save' before exiting the
tool, however.
<br/>
I am now (Sept 2012) using this version of skype:
skype-4.0.0.8-fc16.i586, installed using an rpm file downloaded from the
skype web site:
<br>
<a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-gb/get-skype/on-your-computer/linux/downloading.fedora">http://www.skype.com/intl/en-gb/get-skype/on-your-computer/linux/downloading.fedora</a>

<p>
<a href="#pulse-solved">
<b>NB 2 Jul 2010: Audio problems now solved.</b>
</a>
<br/>
<p>
<li>
<b>Volume control</b>
<br/>
As a volume control I mostly use 'alsamixergui -c 0' invoked either
by command or by a menu option. That works very well.
<br/>
The utility
should be part of the default installation for Fedora.
<p>
The gnome-volume-control utility is also useful. It allows both
input volume and output volume to work, and seems to be able to
start up pulseaudio, as described <a href="#pulse-solved">above.</a>
<p>
The volume up/down keyboard buttons also work in Fedora 13, if I use
runlevel 5 (graphical login), but not otherwise. There's probably
some service I need to start at runlevel 3.
<p>
<li>
<b>Audio output works on both the built in speakers and the earphone outlet.</b>
<br/>
<p>
The default maximum volume level is a little low, but running
'gnome-volume-control' allows me to go above the default 100%.
(My hearing is subnormal).
<br/>
However, as soon as I use alsamixergui to
adjust the volume the maximum level reverts to its previous (lowish)
level.
<p>
The sound is surprisingly good, considering the size of the speakers
and the box they are in, with a reasonable stereo spread.
<br/>
However, it takes only a few sconds of a Beethoven symphony to make
the need for much better speakers obvious.
<p>
<li>
<b>Audio input - voice recording</b>
<br/>
'gnome-sound-recorder' allows me to record and play back speech
using an external microphone.
<br/>
The sound of the recording is noisy if the input volume is
set high, but that may partly be due to use of a poor microphone.
(To be investigated further).
<p>
For recording audio, 'gnome-sound-recorder' works fine, though I had
to experiment with level settings using alsamixergui to get
reasonable quality voice recording.
<p>
When I first installed linux on this machine I could not get the
built-in microphone to work. but it has been working fine since Fedora
15.

<p>
<a name="monitor-problem"></a>
<li>
<b>Main problem: use of external monitor or projector with linux</b>
<br/>
<b>NB FIXED in Fedora 15 (kernel 2.6.38)</b>
<br/>
<br>
I have this package installed, for the intel graphic card:
<pre>
    xorg-x11-drv-intel-2.11.0-5.fc13.i686
</pre>
<p>
At first the machine was unusable with an external monitor with
linux.
<br/>
Eventually fixed in Fedora 15
<p>
<a name="workaround"></a>
<li>
<b>For a while I used a work-around to get graphics to work:
<br/>
(No longer needed since Fedora 15)
<br/>
boot into runlevel 3 and start
X (the full graphical interface), using the 'xstart' command
<br/>
before plugging monitor in, then use lxrandr.
</b>
<p>
This can be broken down into steps as follows:
<p>
1. Download
the <a href="http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXRandR"><b>lxrandr</b></a>
package. E.g. in fedora do:
<small>
<pre>
    yum install lxrandr
</pre>
</small>
For Ubuntu use 'apt-get' instead of 'yum'.
<p>
2. Alter /etc/inittab to make the machine boot into runlevel 3.
<br>
Change
<pre>
    id:5:initdefault:
</pre>
to
<pre>
    id:3:initdefault:
</pre>
3. Then reboot, or as superuser, do this to switch to runlevel 3:
<pre>
    init 3
</pre>
<p>

4. Login, in console mode (text only interface)
<p>

5. Use the 'startx' command to enter graphical mode, starting up X.
<blockquote>
The contents of your file: ~/.xinitrc can determine what starts up
in graphical mode and which window manager you use.
<br/>
(I have tried both OpenBox and CTWM -- my favourite.)
</blockquote>
<p>
6. Plug in your external monitor cable or projector cable -- ONLY
when running in graphical mode, AFTER using 'startx'.
<p>
Plugging in
earlier causes my machine to freeze, requiring a reboot.
<br/>
The xorg intel driver, which takes over when X starts up seems to
manage fine, but so far only in runlevel 3 (or possibly when running
the lxde or lxfe window manager).
<p>
7. Start an xterm or console window, and type:
<pre>
    lxrandr
</pre>
(Or add it to one of your mouse-activated menus.)
<p>

If an external monitor is already plugged in, the 'lxrandr' command
brings up a panel with two buttons, one for choosing the resolution
of your laptop display and one for choosing the resolution of the
external monitor/projector. You can also enable or disable either
display.
<p>
If no monitor is connected, lxrandr lets you change the resolution
of your laptop display.
<blockquote>
<p>
With my 1440x900 display on Dell E6410, lxrandr allows me to have
the laptop at its own resolution and an external wide-screen LG
monitor at 1920x1080, or an older monitor at 1280x1024.
<p>
So not everything that's visible on one screen is visible on the
other. With the 1280x1024 monitor each display has visible portions
not seen in the other.
<p>
The mouse cursor is visible on both, though it can be moved out of
the visible area on one and remain visible on the other.
<p>
The result is quite impressive, but for the fact that the monitor
must not be plugged in too early, and must be unplugged before
the machine is shut down.
<p>
<small>
I had previously been trying to use xrandr commands to connect to an
external monitor, but did not understand the documentation well
enough, and 'xrandr --auto' did not always give me an optimal
result, though on my older Dell D610 it always enabled me to use the
available projector.
</small>
<p>
An alternative to using 'lxrandr' is to use
'gnome-display-properties',  but that does not seem to work in as
many contexts. Perhaps it requires runlevel 5?

<a name="warnings"></a>
<li>
<b>Warnings about use of external monitor with new Intel Graphics [Fixed in Fedora 15]</b>
<br/>
<b>NB</b>
<br/>
Prior to F15, the external monitor must be connected <b>only</b> when
the X window system is already running, and in my experience only
using runlevel 3, not runlevel 5 (graphical login)
otherwise linux crashes as soon as the monitor is plugged in.
<blockquote>
An exception to this rule occurred when I chose the lxde window
manager instead of gnome or openbox during graphical login.
<p>
In that case I could plug in an
external monitor after logging in, and use lxrandr to configure
it. But I am not accustomed to lxde as window manager, and was not
comfortable with its defaults. (I may explore it later).

<b>UPDATE: 15 Jun 2010: Knoppix Live v6.2 does not work on my machine</b>
<br/>
I have found that the latest Knoppix live DVD doesn't work --
the boot process does not complete, presumably because of the
new intel graphic card. It produces a blank screen.
<br/>
Perhaps it needs new drivers to cope with the Intel
1440x900 graphic card on the E6410?
<p>
There may be other distributions that will not work because they
need newer drivers.

<p>
<li>
<b>Problem with full-screen Flash, and a solution</b>
<br/>
The intel-graphic card works well, when it works!
<p>
When full-screen
flash works it is very good -- videos are fast and smooth: much
better than using linux on my Dell D610 with ATI Radeon graphic card,
e.g. using BBC iPlayer; though not quite as smooth as my analogue
22" Sony TV set!
<p>
However I found occasionally that switching to full screen flash
produces a blank screen. It turns out that this is a known problem
with a solution: The cure is
<P>
<ul>
<li>
If you have the blank screen,
use ESC to leave flash full-screen mode.
<li>
    right-click on the flash panel,
<li>
    select 'settings' and disable 'hardware acceleration'.
<li>
    The tip was found <a href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=245615">here</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<li>
<b>Webcam</b>
<br/>
I was amazed to find that the installed webcam just works on Linux.
E.g.
using 'cheese' I was able to take pictures of various resolutions up
to 2048x1536, like the one in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/pics/webcam/">this directory</a>
(to which I may add
more later, perhaps using lower resolution). 'xawtv' also works.
<p>
However, if I use those programs without running gnome I have to run
them as root, e.g. using sudo. There are obviously effects of the
graphical login process that I do not understand -- some good and
some bad, the worst being the effect of plugging in external monitor
mentioned above.
<p>
<li>
<b>Touchpad: has middle mouse button -- excellent!</b>
<br/>
I often use middle button for 'paste' and on most laptops with
only two buttons, I have to use both buttons simultaneously to
emulate middle button click.
<br/>
This is tiresome and error prone.
<p>
The E6410 has three buttons above the touchpad and two buttons
below. I now use the middle button above the pad very often (for
pasting text) -- and don't need to use an external mouse so often.
<p>
There is also a trackpad/trackstick button between keys on the
keyboard, which can be used to move the mouse cursor, as described
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick">here.</a>
<br/>
I don't like it and never use it. (It was also present on my older Dell D610, and
never used.) Apparently some people really like it.
<p>
Linux driver for touchpad works, and supports 'tap to
select', as well as horizontal and vertical scrolling.
<p>
I don't use windows much, but when I do I found the touchpad much
too sensitive and frequently activate items when I intend merely
to move the mouse cursor.
<br/>
For some reason I don't have that problem on linux.
<p>
<li>
Several users have complained about the touchpad used on recent
Dells, claiming that Alps models are inferior to Synaptics models.
As far as I am concerned having a middle mouse button available
makes this by far the best touchpad I have encountered on a laptop
computer.

<b>Selinux Problems</b>
<br/>
On both the laptop and my desktop PC running F13 I was getting
lots of error messages and warning messages from selinux relating to
wicd and other things. So I just disabled it in /etc/selinux/config,
using
<small>
<pre>
    SELINUX=disabled
</pre>
</small>
I now think this should be the default, leaving it to experts who
need Selinux to turn it on. It is disabled on linux machines in our
department using CentOS, presumably because it causes more problems
than it cures.
<br>
<b>NOTE added 4 Apr 2011:</b> I had to add "selinux=0" to the boot command in
grub.conf otherwise when booting it would not mount the root directory.

<p>
<li>
<b>Software/firmware updates installed :</b>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
While running Windows 7, I went to the Dell support web site fr the
E6410 and fetched and installed a number of updates, including two
bios updates.
<p>
I am not sure whether I got any benefits from the changes.
<p>
<li>
I also installed a slightly newer version of the F13 kernel, which
at first seemed to work OK, but after hibernating once or twice, I
had trouble with hibernate. Attempting to hibernate (using
'pm-hibernate') caused my machine to freeze, so I switched to using
tuxonice (available <a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">here</a>)
instead of the standard F13 kernel:
<small>
<pre>
    2.6.33.5-112_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc13.i686 #1 SMP Tue Jun 1 01:48:41 CEST 2010

more recently switched to:
    2.6.33.5-124_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc13.i686 #1 SMP Tue Jun 22 14:49:14 CEST 2010
</pre>
</small>
<b>Update: 2 Jul 2010</b> I am now using tuxonice on both machines.
<br/>
<p>
A major reason for using tuxonice (with the 'hibernate' command) is
that the hibernate/resume mechanism provided in the default fedora
kernel is slower, does not display progress when suspending or
resuming, and also seems to be less robust. The fedora people really
should make tuxonice the default.
<blockquote>
UPDATE: 10 Jul 2010
<br/>
I have found, especially on the older, slower desktop PC, that
sometimes hibernation does not complete, apparently because of lack
of space.
<p>
Symptom:
The hibernation process starts up and then fails, apparently because
of a problem of space. The /var/log/hibernate.log file includes
<a href="hibernate-log.txt">this report.</a>
Sometimes if I give the command again after a few seconds it works.
On other occasions, if I kill firefox hibernate works. Even when it
works hibernate had been taking a much longer time than it used to
before I increased the amount of memory (and the swap space).
<p>
Cure:
The problem seems to have been
removed by altering the file
<pre>
    /etc/hibernate/tuxonice.conf
</pre>
to include this line
<pre>
    ImageSizeLimit nocache
</pre>
as recommended in
<a href="http://www.tuxonice.net/FAQ-5.html">http://www.tuxonice.net/FAQ-5.html</a>
<p>
I had not encountered this problem before I (a) doubled the amount
of RAM on the PC from 1GB to 2GB, and (b) upgraded from Fedora 10 to
Fedora 13, and (c) acquired a new monitor with much higher
resolution (1920x1080) than my old one  (1280x1024).
<p>
I suspect that doubling the amount of physical memory and providing
a large swap area caused linux to create far more disc caches than
previously and when hibernate was writing them all to disc this took
a very long time. Preventing the caches and buffers being written
speeds up the hibernate process considerably, on my machine, and
does not seem to add to the time taken to resume. More importantly
it seems to solve the problem of hibernation failing because of
insufficient space.
<p>
<small>
There is not enough user documentation on how to tailor tuxonice.
E.g. this web site
<a href="http://www.tuxonice.net/HOWTO-4.html">http://www.tuxonice.net/HOWTO-4.html</a>
seems to be written for experts. The 'man hibernate file' includes
<small>
<pre>
   ProcSetting <entry name> <value> (requires UseTuxOnIce on)
             Sets the value of /<entry_name> to <value> upon hibernating.
             You can use this setting to set parameters that can't be con-
             figured anywhere else in this script. This is executed  after
             all other settings have been set.

</pre>
</small>
But gives no information on where to find what parameters are
relevant and how to decide what values to give them. Of course, all
that should not be necessary: the system should figure things out
for itself!
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Swap sizes:</b>
<br/>
I have 4GB main memory on the E6410
and  10GB swap area, possibly more than required.
<br/>
On the desktop PC the figures were 2GB RAM and 4GB Swap. I have
now doubled the swap partition size to 8GB. This may be overkill, but
allows for a possible further increase in memory size. On a 1 TB
hard drive a few extra GB used for swap is not a great loss.

There is an ambient light sensor on the E6410 which can control both

<p>
<li>
<b>Mouse buttons and keyboard</b>
<br/>
I have always liked the feel and most of the layout of Dell latitude
keyboards on my previous laptops. This is at least as good.
<p>
<b>However, it's a pity the PageUp/PageDown keys are not adjacent to
the UpArrow
key, where there are already two unused keys.</b>
<p>
Having a middle mouse button on touchpad is wonderful for many linux
users: I use it a lot for pasting text, and the alternative (when a
usb mouse is not available), as on most other laptops, is to press
left and right buttons simultaneously: annoying and error-prone,
or to use an external mouse -- not always convenient.
<br/>
On
my previous Dell the upper mouse buttons were very sticky and
unreliable. On the E6410 both upper and lower buttons feel ok and
work ok.
<p>
<b>The back-lit keyboard is very useful for working in dim light.</b>
<br/>
The letter names are cut through the key caps allowing the light to
be seen through gaps that show which key each one is.
<p>

<b>The audio volume up/down buttons work on F13, when running
gnome (runlevel 5).</b>
<br/>
I have never had them working on linux previously. I must find a way
to get them working at runlevel 3.
<p>
<li>
<b>Unreadable keyboard labels</b>
<br/>
The 'alternative' (blue) labels
on Function keys are too small and too
faint to be read, except in bright light, peering close, preferably
with a magnifying glass: why use dark blue paint on a very dark
background?
<p>
<li>
<b>No Manuals</b>
<br/>
The laptop came with no manual, especially no instructions on how to
reinstall the OS: I had to guess not only what the blue labels are
for: I also had to guess what to do with the Dell driver CD. It
turns out that are online manuals
<a href="http://support.euro.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/late6410/">here,</a>
including instructions on the sequence to follow when
(re-)installing the operating system.
<br/>
(Thanks to information from
John Cordiner at Dell Support.)
<p>
There was no user manual for the installed operating system, but you
can download a Windows 7 user manual
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=b3c68ec2-e726-4830-ac89-31c71d6be5f3">here.</a>

From a quick search through the manual it seems Windows 7 has not

<b>Annoying flashing lights on Dell Latitude E6410</b>
<br/>
The constantly flashing bright blue lights at top left of keyboard
(wireless, battery, hard drive), are a painful distraction when
working in a dim light.
<p>
I would
not mind if I could reduce their intensity. Likewise the intense
power-button blue light, though at least that doesn't flash. I shall
try find something to cover the lights while working -- perhaps a
flap that I can lift when I want to know whether there is wireless
activity or hard drive activity. It's a pity the battery warning
light isn't separate instead of being in the middle:
that should not be covered.
<p>
<a name="battery"></a>
<li>
<b>Battery Life (Updated: 2 Feb 2011)</b>
<br/>
The new (low power consumption) technology used on this machine
allows the battery to last for much longer on a single charge than a
comparable capacity battery would on older machines, though battery
life depends, of course, on what you do, including whether wireless
is on and whether the screen is bright or dim, whether hard drive is
used a lot etc.
<p>
A few weeks after I acquired the E6410 I noticed that one of my two
9-cell batteries seemed to have a higher capacity than the other.
Further investigation and experimentation convinced me that one of
the batteries (made by Simplo) was much inferior to the other (made
by Samsung), in part because after dropping down from full charge a
few percent the Simplo could not be recharged until it had dropped
even further, to about 95% of full charge. This meant that before a
long journey I could not ensure that that battery was fully charged
simply by inserting the charger and waiting for the 'flashing'
indicator to stop: if a few percent below full charge, it
misleadingly did not flash at all, giving the false impression of
being fully charged. Also, in that state, the bios battery display
clearly indicated that the batter was not not fully charged, and was
not charging. I first had to artificially discharge the battery to
the level when it would again start charging: surely doing this
often would shorten its life? The Samsung/Dell battery did not have
this problem. Moreover, even when fully charged the Simplo had a
lower capacity than the Samsung.
<p>
So I contacted Dell service, via their web site (filling in a form,
which required me to have my order number). The response I got was
friendly and helpful, but led to a long confusing saga, summarised
<a href="dell-batts.html">here.</a>
<p>
NOTE 1:
There are some web sites claiming that
many owners of laptop computers have their batteries damaged by
running Windows 7. Some of them say it's only the 64 bit Win 7
(which I don't have) that damages batteries. Microsoft deny all the
claims. See
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprohardware/thread/8a74c53b-406f-4ce6-a1ae-da1dd11b8d1a">this microsoft forum
page.</a>
<br/>
I hardly ever use Windows 7, since all my work is done on Linux, but
this is still a worrying possibility.
<p>
NOTE 2: The latest Dell latitudes allow two rates of charging for
the battery. You can select between them in the bios. The default is
fast/express charge. Some months after acquiring this machine I read
on a web site that batteries last longer if the fast charge mode is
not used. Dell do not provide any information about this,
unfortunately. Anyhow I re-set the bios option to normal charge
rate.
<p>
<a name="weight"></a>
<li>
<b>Not really light-weight</b>
<br/>
I found that when travelling with the Latitude D610, with several
hours a day out of reach of a power supply (e.g. on a long distance
flight) I had to take one or more spare batteries in addition to
using a battery to replace the DVD drive in the media bay on the
D610. I think I shall have less weight to carry around, but not much
less now. Using grotty inaccurate kitchen scale:
<small>
<pre>
    D610 with two batteries     (5lb  8oz, 2.56Kg)
    D610 with only main battery (4lb 13oz, 2.2Kg)
        secondary battery       (12oz,     0.36Kg)

    E6410 with 9cell battery    (4lb 14oz,  2.21 Kg)
    E6410 with no battery       (3lb 14oz,  1.76 Kg)
    9 Cell battery:             (1lb  0oz,  0.45 Kg)

    [Please treat the numbers as very approximate.]

<a name="wireless"></a>
<li>
<b>Wireless connections</b>
<br/>
The intel wireless adapter works fine. I previously used my own
scripts to start and stop it in various contexts though wicd works
so well I have switched to using that. As usual when I tried using
NetworkManager, it just got in the way, so I removed it from the
machine. My wireless router was recently upgraded from 802.11g to
11n and the broadband cable download speed increased from 20 to
30mb/s. The intel wireless card works perfectly and I get almost the
same speed as with the ethernet connection to the router..
<p>
Information about how I connect to the Birmingham University wifi
service, using wpa encryption is <a href="wpa/">here.</a>
<br/>
It explains, among other things, that I have to use 'dhclient -r'
before trying to make a dhcp wireless connection. That is not a
feature of this laptop.
<p>
Although wireless works, at first I had problems because the
the label for the wireless device
on Fedora has switched from 'eth1' to 'wlan0' causing problems for
me, though probably not for most other linux users.
<p>
That's because
I use home-grown scripts for setting up network connections in
slightly different ways (e.g. different 'known hosts') in different
contexts (e.g. home, office, visiting colleagues, at airports,
hotels, etc.), and those scripts stopped working, and my scripts
referred to 'eth1' not 'wlan0'.
<p>
NetworkManager could not cope and seemed to get in the way, so I
removed it completely from the system.
Installing 'wicd' gave me a working system. It should be part of the
default Fedora distribution.
<p>
It took some time to sort out the changes needed to my scripts. Some
involved checking all the files, including all the interface
specifications for different sites, and making sure that I not only
replaced 'eth1' with 'wlan0' throughout but also replaced old mac
addresses with new ones, for both ethernet and wireless.
<p>
This demonstrated that my system (described <a href="wpa">here</a>)
is not sufficiently modular and will need to switch to using
dynamically generated scripts using an easily changeable set of
parameters, when I have time. The scripts now work at home and for
connection to UoBWifi on campus, so I don't need wicd, except for
ad-hoc temporary connections at hotels, airports, etc.
<p>
I also had to add a new command to 'wake up' the
wireless card, which can be switched off externally on Dell's latest
Latitude series. When switched back on again, the current linux
network software apparently does not notice automatically.
While sorting out the scripts, I was able to use wicd to connect to
a wireless service, until I had sorted out my scripts. The version
that now works with Fedora 13 on
the E6410 for connecting to my wpa-based wireless
access point at home is <a href="wpa/nethome-wlan.txt">here.</a>
<p>
<li>
<b>Problem turning Wireless on and off -- fixed</b>
<br/>
For a while I thought that on the E6410 the only way to turn
wireless power off (very important for conserving battery power) is
using the new (very convenient) switch on the edge of the case.
<p>
I found that switching wireless back on enabled windows 7 wireless
connections to work, but not on linux, until I found these commands
<small>
<pre>
    iwconfig eth0 txpower on
    iwconfig eth0 txpower off
</pre>
</small>
The first command restores power to the wireless card. I had to do
that for wicd as well as for my own scripts.

<p>
<li>
<b>Fan noise</b>
<br/>
I mostly don't hear sounds from the fan (though the CD/DVD drive is
fairly noisy).
<br/>
The machine stays much cooler than the D610.
<p>
<li>
<b>Power supplies/Chargers (Updated 24 Jun 2010)</b>
<br>
I ordered two extra chargers (90w AC Adapters). Of the three, two
arrived with the little 'blobble' broken off the button used to hold
the strap in place when wound round the cable. I asked Dell for
replacement buttons. They should be easy to install.
<p>
However, Dell support said they would send me complete new chargers,
not just the buttons, as compensation for inconvenience. They were
very helpful, including checking that the new items had arrived (in
particular
Andrea Kromholcova, of
<a href="http://www.dell.co.uk">Dell UK</a>
Customer Care).
<p>
<b>Confusing web site information about Dell AC power supply/Charger</b>
<br/>
The online
information about these chargers is somewhat confusing. It turns out
there are two models. Both have cables about 2m long between the
power supply and the laptop, but one version has a 1m cable to power
socket and the other has a 2m cable. I previously found the 1+2m
length available on the D610 charger too short, e.g. in badly
designed seminar rooms. The extra metre will  be very useful.
<p>
Despite having a higher power rating the new power brick is thinner
and also apparently lighter than the old 60 Watt one.
<p>

</ul>

<h3><b>
<b>Background</b>
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Before I bought this model of laptop I was considering using Fedora
12 or 13 on the new machine.
<p>
I had already been using
F12 on my older laptop (Dell D610),
<a href="#F12-D610"> as described below, </a>
but thought the new laptop might
need a newer version of linux because it includes some new hardware.
<p>
In order to gain experience of F13 on familiar hardware, I therefore
tried upgrading my 5 year old desktop PC (using AMD Athlon64), which
was running Fedora 10, to F13, for practice. It was generally
successful. For more details on that installation, which raised some
problems which I had to solve, see <a href="#preparing">below.</a>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Obstructive Windows 7...</b>
<blockquote>
My first problem was that Dell had installed Windows 7 in such a way
that it used up the whole drive and proved impossible to shrink
leaving space for fedora -- including stupidly giving users only ONE
usable windows partition, which I would think even Windows users
would not wish on such a large drive.
<p>
In my frustration I accidentally deleted the Windows7 partition, so
used Dell's 'recovery' CDs to reinstall it, That seemed to work,
although one of the partitions that Dell had installed, a small one
after the main Windows partition, did not re-appear. So Win7 now
requires only two partitions instead of three, one of the two
apparently being a small (100 MB) boot partition (?). Windows 7
works fine as far as I can tell (I gave it 60 GB, and have kept a
spare 40 GB ntfs partition unused in case I ever want more for
windows (e.g. saved BBC iPlayer stuff?). I am not really a windows
user, and I leave windows on my laptop because I have paid for it,
I can spare the space I have given it, and it is sometimes useful
for checking that hardware is not at fault. Dell service engineers
may require it.
<br/>
<p>
My accidental deletion occurred while using the Fedora 13 Live cd.
The partition editor provided is not nearly as convenient as
gparted. The latter should be standard for Fedora.
<p>
Dell's installation of Windows 7 on the 500GB hard drive is stupid
and obstructive, (a) because they installed windows in one huge
partition, which nobody is likely to want and (b) they made it
impossible to shrink that partition and create new partitions.
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>
<b>Fedora 13 Pass 1 -- not quite right</b>
<br/>
My first installation of F13, carefully restricted to a subset of
the remaining space on the drive, seemed to go very well. But when I
later tried getting my networking scripts to work I met problems
because I have been using 'eth1' for wireless and for some reason
Fedora now have switched to 'wlan0', and simply editing my scripts
did not work. I also failed to reinstate 'eth1' for wireless use.
<p>
I did manage later to sort out wireless for F13, as described
<a href="#wireless">above.</a>
<p>
Since Fedora 12 (F12) had been working fine on my older laptop (Dell
Latitude D610) I thought I would try that, using a new partition for
root.
<p>
<li>
<b>Trying F12 instead</b>
<br/>
Unfortunately I found that F12 has also switched from 'eth1' to
'wlan0', and I could not get wireless networking to operate
consistently, even though it works perfectly on my D610 using F12.
I also could not get sound to work and was faced with the prospect
of going through a tortuous process of removing all trace of
pulseaudio (as on the D610) and getting alternative sound mechanisms
to work,
so instead of wasting more hours I decided to go back to F13.
<p>
I had noticed three other problems while using F12 which were
presumably due to new hardware -- drivers not yet ready:
<small>
<pre>
1. Attempting to attach an external monitor crashed Fedora, while
    running gnome.

2. The use of touch-pad (Alps) for scrolling did not work, even
   though it had worked perfectly on F12 with the other laptop.

3. Attaching a USB mouse worked fine,  but not a USB keyboard: no
   characters were received, and worse, it made the internal keyboard
   stop working also: reboot required.

</pre>
</small>
So, back to Fedora 13, which cured point 3. As explained above I
found that booting into run-level 3 cured point 1.
I am hoping later
releases will cure point 2.
<p>
<li>
<b>F13 Pass 2, working after all (mostly)</b>
<p>
I reinstalled F13, using a new partition for root, in case I had to
go back to F12, but using the same 'home' partition (which I had not
encrypted, to allow it to be easily shared across versions of
linux).
<p>
I tried gnome and kde for a while but disliked both intensely, in
different ways, so went back to using Openbox, which loses some of
the applets, but otherwise suits me (though not as well as CTWM did
before its functionality proved limited -- it did not handle the
full screen option in flash),

<b>RTNETLINK Ethernet Problem in Fedora 13</b>
<blockquote>
UPDATED: 3 Jul 2010
<br/>
Since the original installation, I have not been using the Dell
Laptop with cable, using only the wireless connection. The
hibernate/resume process works fine, using a tuxonice kernel on the
laptop and a wireless connection, using WPA. (I don't use
NetworkManager, and I have shell scripts for starting the wireless
connection in different locations, as described
<a href="wpa">here.</a>)
<p>
However, on my desktop PC running F13, using a cable connection
instead of wireless, and also running a tuxonice kernel, for a while
I had problems with the ethernet connection after hibernate/resume.
<p>
The problem of not being able to reconnect has gone away now, using
this kernel

<pre>
    2.6.33.5-124_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc13.i686
</pre>
and giving the 'hibernate' command while at runlevel 3:
<p>
However, I now find that after resuming from hibernation, the
machine displays this message in the xterm window in which I give
the 'hibernate' command:

However everything seems to work, provided I do it all at runlevel

it sometimes fails to complete the hibernation process, but without
any explanation -- it just returns to the previous running state.
<p>
Despite the above message everything now works after resuming at
runlevel 3, including automatic re-opening of the network
connection.
<p>
<b>Earlier problem now gone:</b>
<br/>
At an earlier stage,
when testing F13 on my desktop machine, with its
ethernet connection, I found it difficult to get the ethernet
connection to restart after hibernate/resume. This message used to
appear.
<small>
<pre>

At that stage I could connect by rebooting the machine.

30 May 2010: Installing F13 on Desktop PC:
<br/>
Preparing for Fedora 13 on Dell Latitude 6410
</b></h3>
<small>
I ordered the
<a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/featuresdetails.aspx/latitude-e6410?c=uk&l=en&cs=ukbsdt1">Dell 6410</a>
to replace my aging and under-configured D610. Because of new
graphics and other features I thought I should try Fedora 13,
instead of F12, which I am using on the current laptop, though I
would not normally install something so new. To check out the
process I decided to upgrade my desktop machine from F10 to F13
instead of F12. I encountered some problems, and solutions,
described below, though basically the installation was successful.
I then installed Linux on the E6410 laptop when it arrived. The
process had ups and downs, but was over all successful eventually
apart from two driver problems, one serious. To see a report on the
laptop
installation look <a href="#installing-E6410">here.</a> The rest of
this section reports on experience with F13 on the desktop PC.

<b>Trying Fedora 13 on a desktop PC</b>
<br/>
I wanted to try this out on an older working machine first, so that
I could easily revert to a previous working version if I had
problems. In particular, I have never tried encrypting hard drives,
which I know I should do on a machine that I take to meetings and
conferences. So I decided to install F13 in an unused portion of a
large 1TB Western Digital drive, using 4 new partitions: one for
swap (and software suspend), one for /boot, one for root(/) and one
for /home, knowing that I could go back to the working version of
F10 using an older drive, if necessary.

This and the next web site tell you what to do to extend information
about repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/
<br/>
Following that advice made it very easy to use yum and the
corresponding graphical tool yumex to fetch or uninstall packages,
with all dependencies automatically looked after. This seems to
remove one of the previously important advantages of Ubuntu over
Fedora.
<p>
(My main complaint about yumex is that there doesn't
seem to be any documentation on what the peculiar symbols used to
indicate status of packages mean: you have to guess. In general it
needs tutorial documentation, which I could not find.
<br/>
Another problem is that there seems to be no way to mark something
as 'I never want this', so that it is not included in future in
update lists or available lists.
<br/>
Despite the annoyances I manage to use it for many things,
especially uninstalling unwanted packages. I expect it would be
much more frustrating to use if I did not have 20Mb cable
broadband.)

<p>
<b>General first impressions of Fedora 13 on Desktop machine</b>
<br/>
It was in some ways the easiest Linux install I have ever done
(although they still make the process of choosing packages to
install very tedious: there should be away of asking for all
packages containing e.g. 'font' and selecting a subset, or all
packages concerning latex, etc.
<p>
Apart from that tedium everything worked at first (including
pulseaudio for the first time ever for me, though I later had
problems when I switched to booting into runlevel 3. The problems
are now solved, <a href="#pulse-solved">as described above.</a>
<p>
But I had some problems with networking, because I had
previously been using my own scripts and they no longer worked.
However eventually I sorted out the problems. Nevertheless I had a
usable system. The hibernate-restore mechanism in the standard linux
distribution as usual gave problems, so once again I installed the
'tuxonice' kernels: tuxonice is much more robust, faster, and has a
nice display showing what is going on during hibernation and resume.
WHY isn't that the default for linux???
<p>
<hr/>
<p>
<b>A problem caused by encrypting partitions</b>
<br/>
At one point during the process of configuring F13, I had corrupted
my /etc/fstab which was on the root partition which was encrypted.
The error prevented booting, and the encryption potentially made it
difficult to get at the partition using a 'live cd', but fortunately
the 'fedora13 live' cd enabled me to mount the encrypted root
partition, and fix the problem with /etc/fstab.
<p>
After I had installed two versions of Fedora on the same machine,
using encrypted file partitions I found that while running F13
I could not access files on an encrypted partition installed with
F12, and vice versa. Later I found how to put appropriate entries in
/etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab, which I shall document later.
<p>
I think that on the new laptop I should restrict the use of
encryption to one partition  and ensure that anything private is on
that. Apart from the potential inconvenience of dealing with
unnecessarily encrypted files if something goes wrong, reading and
writing to encrypted files uses more cpu power, and
could reduce battery time.
<p>
In spite of the extra load, Fedora 13  boots faster than any
previous version of Linux I have used, and even gnome starts fairly
quickly, though I switched to openbox which is faster, smaller and
more configurable.
<hr/>
<p>
<b>Dictatorial Gnome Developers</b>
<br/>
I searched for ages to find how to tell gnome that (for several
reasons that have to do with working efficiently, not just personal
taste) I want 'focus follows mouse', not 'click to focus', and
failed.
<p>
Google told me that lots of other people were complaining about
this. It turns out that the Gnome developers, apparently with the
approval of Fedora people, decided not to include that even as an
option in the default configuration: you have to find, fetch and
load an extra package to convert your windows preferences menu to
allow that. That sort of dictatorship by designers convinces me that
I should never use Gnome for serious work. Anyhow, I did find two
ways to fix this, one using the gconf-editor instead of the standard
preferences menu:
<small>
<pre>
    Run 'gconf-editor'.
    Select Edit, then Find. Type in "metacity" (WITHOUT clicking on
    either of the 2 tickboxes underneath).
    Select 'general', then right click on 'focus mode', and
    select 'edit'. You can choose "click" (the dictatorial default)
    "mouse" for focus follows mouse, or "sloppy" which means windows
    are focused when the mouse enters the window, so you won't lose
    focus by moving mouse to root window.
</pre>
</small>
The other option required an obscure extra package to be loaded to
modify the gnome preferences menu. Both worked, but the decision to
make the option so hard to find shows a terribly dictatorial and
inconsiderate mind-set in the Gnome developers.
<p>
I have not had time to find out if KDE is any better, and in any
case I want something smaller, simpler, cleaner, than either, e.g.
openbox (which I am currently using or ctwm which I like even better
but is no longer consistent with recent X window standards (e.g.
supporting full screen flash). I much prefer a system like openbox
or ctwm that allows me to set all my preferences in a text file,
that can easily be copied from one machine to another (or
reinstalled after an upgrad) instead of going through tedious and
error prone procedures selecting menu options.

<p>
<hr/>
<b>Java problems with browsers</b>
<br/>
The default installation of F13 gave me the JDK version of Java,
which suffices for many purposes, but since I need Sun Java some of
the time I fetched and installed the latest jre. Unfortunately that
stopped firefox, seamonkey and opera working. They crashed with
complaints like
<small>
<pre>
    INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Could not get the plugin manager
    System error?:: Success
</pre>
</small>
Google soon showed me that many people have had this problem and
there are many suggestions on mutual help files about what to do,
most of which appear not to work. One that should have but did not
is use of '/usr/sbin/alternatives' in something like this format:
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/share/...java... 20000
</pre>
I could not get that to do the job.
<p>
Eventually I worked out that the problem was installing sun's java
while the jdk system was installed, and as a result browsers were
looking in the wrong places to find plugins. I have a directory
(which I can retain across changes of linux versions):
<pre>
    /usr/local/mozilla.plugins
</pre>
in which I include links to plugins, including, for example,
<ul>
<li>
nphelix.so, for realplay, provided in RealPlayer11GOLD.bin
<li>
libflashplayer.so, obtained from Adobe
<li>
libjavaplugin_oji.so, the old java plugin, available here on my
machine:

<pre>
    /usr/local/src/java/jre1.6.0_20/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
</pre>

<li>
libnpjp2.so, the newer plugin required for recent versions of
Firefox, available here on my machine
<pre>
    /usr/local/src/java/jre1.6.0_20/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so
</pre>
</ul>
The problem was where to put links to those plugins. Simply using
<pre>
    ~/.mozilla/plugins
</pre>
did not seem to work with current versions of web browsers, and did
not get rid of the 'plugin manager error'. However I found various
places where there seemed to be plugins, and inserted links to the
links in my mozilla.plugins directory. I should have kept a list of
all of them, but these are examples:
<pre>
    /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
    /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins-wrapped/
</pre>
I am not sure the second one is needed. I also found some other
directories containing browser plugins, which I suspect were
spurious relics. I'll later collect a list and include them here,
after doing experiments to see which ones are not needed.
<p>
I also found that after installing 'jre' from Sun, I had to do some
editing of files in /etc/java, and /etc/alternatives/. I all
links to jdk and java items in the jdk directories, and removed
them.
<p>
Now, firefox, opera, and seamonkey all work ok with java and flash.
<hr/>
<p>
<b>Pulseaudio works, at last</b>
<br/>
For the last few versions of Fedora, up to Fedora 12, I had to
remove all trace of pulseaudio after installation in order to get
sound working. However, after installing F13, sound worked after I
ran alsamixer, pressed F6, which showed me the option of selecting
the Nvida sound card, which I chose. Since then I have not had a
problem with sound -- until I changed /etc/inittab to boot into
runlevel 3, instead of runlevel 5, as I prefer running in the
simpler environment. At first pulseaudio then would not work, but I
eventually solved the problem <a href="#pulse-solved">as described above.</a>

<hr/>
<p>
<b>X.org Nvidia graphic driver works</b>
<br/>
So far I have found no reason to go to the nvidia site to get their
proprietary driver. The nvida graphics card was detected
automatically during installation and seems to work very well,
including running glxgears in the default configuration. However,
switching the BBC iPlayer to full screen produces slightly jerky,
slightly blurred results. I don't know if that's due to the age of
the card or the use of the linux driver instead of Nvidia's. I don't
play computer games and don't often watch full screen videos.
<p>
Previously the nvidia driver proved incompatible with software
suspend (hibernate). I may try it with this new version of Fedora
when I have time.
<p>
Both 'vlc' and 'smplayer' work ok, in addition to flash and java on
web sites.
<p>
The <b>glxgears</b> program runs reasonably quickly and smoothly,
printing out
<small>
<pre>
    983 frames in 5.0 seconds = 196.594 FPS
    940 frames in 5.0 seconds = 187.966 FPS
    971 frames in 5.0 seconds = 194.111 FPS

<a name="xterm-font"></a>
<b>Xterm and font problems</b>
<br/>
I use a programmable text editor (Ved) for all my work (even
composing html like this, with edit commands inserting the more
complex html tags). It has the great benefit of being just as easy
to use on a remote machine accessed via ssh as on the local machine,
provided the access is in an xterm window, or equivalent. The editor
requires the window in which it is running to emulate full 'xterm'
functionality (originally derived from the 'vt100' dumb terminal),
e.g. inserting or deleting lines or changing highlighting on receipt
of special control signals (preceded by ESC).
<p>
Unfortunately not all the terminals provided in linux nowadays have
the full set of character control facilities provided by 'xterm',
even if they have other fancy extras, like menus for setting
preferences, etc. In particular 'gnome-terminal' can't handle all
the screen control commands, though it comes close.
<p>
The KDE terminal invoked as 'konsole' is much better than
gnome-terminal, insofar as it handles all the screen control signals
properly, so that all the scrolling works as expected. However it is
also much worse because the function keys do not work with the VT100
or xterm functionality and apparently cannot be made to transmit
anything but their inadequate defaults. This does however, mean that
for users who are willing to do everything with the main keyboard,
plus ESC and CTRL, the 'konsole' program is acceptable.
<p>
Anyhow xterm does what I need, but for many years I have used it
with fonts specified as '10x20', '8x13bold', but the default set of
fonts supplied by F13 did not include those. I've also found in the
past that that 'legacy' fonts required by 'tgif' are not present.
<br>
This seemed to be connected with the fact that starting up 'xterm'
caused this to be printed out, though it had no other effect:
<small>
<pre>
    Warning: Cannot convert string "nil2" to type FontStruct
</pre>
</small>
There are many other people reporting this problem on the internet,
all apparently bemused by it. Something I did later, involving
installation of additional fonts required by some package, caused
that warning to disappear. I remain mystified.
<p>
I did some exploring and found that the following fonts were quite
suitable for use with 'xterm', providing a range of font sizes:
<small>
<pre>
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-8-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-10-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-12-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-14-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-17-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-18-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-20-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-26-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
     -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-34-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
</pre>
</small>
I used a subset of those in my .Xdefaults to specify fonts for the
'xterm' font menu.
<p>
I shall also have to change the default fonts used in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html">Poplog,</a>
selected many years ago, to include only fonts likely to be used by
most people, at least for English.
<p>
<b>FONTS UPDATE 1 Jun 2010:</b>
<br/>
Something I installed, and I did not notice at the time which
package it was, also installed a required set of fonts. It turns out
that these include the fonts that Pop-11 and Ved have been using.
However it is useful to know the above can work as an alternative.
For several days, instead of using '10x20' as my default font, I
have been using

<pre>
    -b&h-*-medium-r-*-sans-18-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
</pre>

This is quite tolerable, and gets a few more lines per inch onto the
screen, which can be useful, though it is slightly cramped.

<br/>
See above, and my <a href="openbox">Openbox web page</a>

<p>
<b>Facilities for managing HP Deskjet D2360 were not available by default</b>
<br/>
It took quite a bit of messing around with yumex and
system-config-printer before my printer would work after the
upgrade. The HP printer libraries were not included in the initial
selections I made when installing Fedora, and searching for them
using 'yumex' did not at first get me all the required packages
(e.g. hplip), which had not been a problem with previous versions of
Fedora. But a bit more probing turned them up, and 'hp-levels' draws
the cartridge ink levels using characters in an xterm window, like
this (colours not included here):
<small>
<pre>
    Black cartridge
    Part No.: 21

    |////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////      | (approx. 90%)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</small>
(The
original cartridges for this printer were terribly expensive, but now the
XL versions are much better value for money, and the printer has
worked much better than my previous Lexmark and Epson printers,
both of which stopped working after two or three years.)
<hr/>
<p>
<b>The tedium of installing</b>
<br/>
It can be very time-consuming to get a new installation of Fedora to
replicate all the previous functionality. I believe the 'preupgrade'
facility automates the process of attempting to replicate the
existing installation in a new installation of Fedora. This
presumably does not help much if you wish to replicate it on a
different machine. It would be useful if one option for preupgrade
were to be production of a file or directory specifying everything
that needs to be in the new version of Fedora. Then in principle,
when the installer asks you to go through its terribly tedious menus
trying to remember what you need, it should instead either allow you
to plug in a USB memory stick with all the information in a standard
form, or else allow the user to specify the location in a file
system that is not being used for the new installation, or allow a
URL to be given that points to the specification on a web site.
<hr/>
<p>
<b>ADDED 1 Jun 2010: Hibernate and resume</b>
<br/>
I found that selecting hibernate from the gnome system menu (an
option not provided in the OpenBox menus that I have found), worked
fine. But not the pm-hibernate command: the hibernation failed and I
had to power down and restart. However, this seems to be overcome by
defining an alias (which I have defined as 'hib') for
<small>
<pre>
    sudo pm-hibernate --auto-quirks
</pre>
</small>
It seems to shut down and resume faster than when I was using Fedora
10 with tuxonice (which I have so far not tried with F13, and may
not need to if the default system works ok). It may be faster only
because root and swap are now on my new WD 1 terabyte drive,
instead of the older seagate.
<blockquote>
<b>UPDATE: 1 Jun 2010</b>
<br/>
Alas, after a while I discovered that pm-hibernate works only once
or twice, after which it failed, and the machine had to be rebooted.
<p>
So I installed Tuxonice for F13. At first I could not get that to
work, because the swap area was no longer accessible. Something had
happened to its encryption, apparently. 'top' showed no swap space.
I tried going back to the ordinary kernel (i.e. not Tuxonice) and
when that ran it also had no swap area.
<p>
So I decided that encrypting the swap area had been a mistake and
ran

<pre>
    mkswap /dev/sdc2
</pre>
    followed by

<pre>
    swapon -a
</pre>
then rebooted. At that stage 'top' showed that the swap area was
being used. Since I had altered the entry for swap in /etc/fstab to
reflect the new format I tried hibernate/resume (with tuxonice).
That's what I now use after some ups and downs. (3 Jul 2010). I much
prefer having the graphical display provided by tuxonice, showing
the progress of suspend and resume, instead of having to sit and
watch a blank screen wondering what is happening.

<hr/>
<p>
<b>ADDED 1 Jun 2010: Selinux errors</b>
<br/>
I get lots of panels mentioning selinux errors that I don't
understand. Some the options to submit reports don't work because I
don't have an account at the receiving site. Some of the reports
give me an 'authenticate' option, which I have selected, though the
list of errors does not indicate that this has been done. I have the
impression that for a desktop machine behind a firewall at home,
selinux gives more trouble than  benefits.
<br/>
So I disabled selinux as many others have done. Alter /etc/selinux/config,
to include
<pre>
    SELINUX=disabled

    <a href="huawei-220-linux.html">This web page</a> gives further information about how I use the T-mobile web'n'walk
    mobile broadband USB stick on a machine running Fedora 10.

    It probably works with many different configurations of linux, though
    I understand some Ubuntu users have found that recent (late 2009)
    versions of the NetworkManager interface to mobile broadband is broken.

    <b>WARNING:</b>
    The t-mobile service has an under-18 lock which is turned on by default
    to prevent access to 'social networks'. This even blocks google mail and
    signing in to a google account, though not yahoo mail, which is
    stupid and arbitrary (especially when they have the information that
    I am over 70). The web site says you can remove the block interactively,
    but that works only for phone users not mobile broadband users. I have
    complained. Others should too!
    After they removed the block I could access google mail when running the
    t-mobile software on windows, but not when using linux. I don't know why.
    It just hangs, with no explanation. <b>T-mobile need to fix their service.</b>

Partial history of this web site

<blockquote>

<b>Linux on my Laptop:</b>
<br/>
<small>
I had long been a unix/solaris
`juser (starting using unix around 1976
at Sussex University). Later, I began using various versions of
RedHat Linux, starting with version 6, on a Dell Latitude (with
400mhz celeron) in 1999 and ending with RedHat version 9 in 2003,
<p>
This website was started when I obtained the Dell Latitude D600 in
2003. I started with RedHat 9 then switched to Fedora Core 3,
then replaced the D600 with a D610 in October 2005, then later
switched to Fedora Core 5, then Fedora 7 in July 2007, followed by
Fedora 8 in 2008, and Fedora 10 in January 2009
</small>

<p>

<b>Linux on my Desktop:</b>
<br/>
<small>
<b>Departmental</b>
<br>
In our department (School of Computer Science, University of
Birmingham) we started switching from using Suns to using PCs
running linux (except for our central servers, which remained Suns
for several years) around 2000. When we moved to a new building in
2001 I was given a Pentium 4 PC running some version of Redhat,
which was later replaced by Whitebox, then CentOS, and my machine
was upgraded in 2007.
<p>
<b>Home</b>
<br>
In 2001 I finally started using a 1Ghz AMD Athlon PC running linux
(RedHat) on my desktop at home, instead of a 10 year old Sun
workstation. Later (around 2006) that was replaced by a 2Ghz AMD
Athlon 64. I moved through various versions of linux (32 bit
versions, since I had no need for 64 bit addresses), starting with
Redhat 7 I think, then Redhat 9, then various versions of Fedora.
<p>
For the sake of continuity I don't upgrade my laptop and desktop at
the same time e.g. I had fedora 4 and 6 and now 9 on my desktop and
fedora 3, 5, 7 and 8 on my laptop. I tried Ubuntu temporarily on a
spare machine, but found that it had no advantages (for me) over
Fedora -- especially after a version of the 'synaptic' package
manager became available for RedHat/Fedora.
<p>
Note added 1 Aug 2008:
<br/>
I've learnt that 'yumex' on Fedora provides what appears to be
similar functionality to 'synaptic'. It may even be better -- I have
not yet looked closely enough to decide.
<br/>
Note added 6 Jun 2009: I have been using yumex for several months
and it is excellent, even though it displays icons that it does not
explain!

<b>UPDATE 18 Jun 2009: Using Mobile Broadband USB stick</b>
<br/>
<a href="huawei-220-linux.html">This web page</a> gives information
about how to use the T-mobile web'n'walk mobile broadband USB stick
on a machine running Fedora 10. It probably works with many
different configurations of linux. (See later update above.)
<p>
<li>
<b>UPDATE 22 Feb 2009: Fedora 10 on my desktop</b>
<br>
I installed F10 on my desktop PC early in January, including
'tuxonice' (Software Suspend 2), and everything seemed to
work very well, as long as I avoided the Nvidia driver (which
interfered with suspend/resume and used only 'nv'.
<br/>
However after a while I kept finding the graphical interface
freezing, with Xorg taking up 99.8% of cpu time, and mouse and
keyboard not working, though I could log in from my laptop. For a
while I reverted to the 2.6.27.5-117 kernel (with tuxonice), and
that seemed to work. However, a few days ago a new kernel became
available, and since switching to that, the problem has gone
away: <small>2.6.27.15-170.2.24_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc10.i686
</small>
<p>
After one of the kernel changes pulseaudio stopped working, which
seems to be a problem
<a href="http://blog.mrtomlinux.org/index.php?post/Pulseaudio-CPU-nightmare">for many linux users.</a>
So I followed the advice
of one of them and simply used 'yum remove...' to remove pulseaudio
from my machine. After that audio worked as expected! I had to do
the same on my laptop running F8. (I believe problems with
pulseaudio are not restricted to Fedora. The people working on it
seem to be trying to do something useful, but failing to accommodate
all the different combinations of hardware and software. So probably
it should never be installed by default on a linux system until
all the problems have been fixed.)

Note, Fedora no longer uses /etc/sysconfig/harddisks, as explained

UPDATE 25 Dec 2006: RealPlayer problem solved
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Previously I wrote:
<blockquote>
<small>
A mystifying problem remains. On the D610 if I try to run the BBC
realplayer based video news player (http://news.bbc.co.uk/) it works
fine, until I use xine or mplayer to display a video. After that nothing
using realplayer works (apart from sound) until I restart the X window
system. I don't have that problem on the D600. If anyone can tell me how
to 'refresh' the video capability of realplayer without stopping and
restarting X11 I'll be grateful. (At least it's not as bad as having to
reboot). Merely switching to a text console (e.g. Fn+ALT+F2) and back
does not work.
</small>
</blockquote>
I discovered by accident how to solve this problem.
<ul>
<li>
Run realplay.
<li>
Select tools --> preferences
<li>
Select Hardware
<li>
Under 'driver options', if Use Xvideo is selected, deselect it.
<li>
Apply
</ul>
I made this discover while
running RealPlayer 10.0.8.805 (gold) (built July 2006).
The problem had occurred both on my desktop PC running Fedora Core 6 and
on my Dell D610 running Fedora Core 5. The above steps have fixed the
problem on both. It also worked on F7.

<b>
Booting up in non-graphic mode and using CTWM for window manager
</b>
<blockquote>
I don't like booting straight into graphic mode not least because that
adds to the load on the machine and slows down booting. So I edited the
file
<pre>
    /etc/inittab
</pre>
changing the line
<pre>
    id:5:initdefault:
</pre>
to make it boot into state 3 (full multi-user mode without
graphics) rather than state 5 (multi-user mode with X11):
<pre>
    id:3:initdefault:
</pre>
<a name="ctwm2"></a>
When it boots up I get a 'login' prompt on a text console, and after
logging in I can run 'startx' to initiate the X window system. I control
its behaviour using a file .xinitrc, which starts a clock, a couple of
Xterm windows in different virtual desktops, and then run the small,
fast, highly tailorable and extremely robust window manager ctwm
(version 3.7). To show how small ctwm is, here is part of the output of
'top', with ctwm running:

<pre>
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 9758 axs       15   0  6456 2172 1692 S  0.0  0.2   0:00.11 ctwm
</pre>
<p>
I use ctwm with 8 or 10 virtual desktops, and lots of keyboard
bindings to reduce use of mouse, including going to next or previous
virtual desktop.
<blockquote>
<small>
Is ctwm the only window manager that
supports the 'wrap' default when you cycle through virtual desktops:
i.e. when I get to the last desktop, the 'next
desktop' function takes
me back to desktop 1, and likewise the 'previous desktop' when on
desktop 1?
<p>
I expected this to work on gnome when I tried it, but the gnome
designers do not seem to understand elegance: so, there's no
wrapping.
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
Use of mouse in the root window
gives access to menus selected by all three buttons. E.g. a menu
item invoking xvidmode enables instant switching of screen
resolution instead of having to go through a tool to switch or
cycling through resolutions using CTRL+ALT+PLUS/MINUS. I get a new
xterm (console) window instantly by pressing key F1 with mouse
cursor not in any application. etc. etc. (xvidtune can also be
invoked).
<p>
The .ctwmrc file makes it possible to do many kinds of tailoring very
easily, including specifying that some windows should be visible in all
desktops, some should have no title bar, etc. etc. I used to find that
ctwm always compiled easily from source. But it uses 'xmkmf' which is no
longer included in FC5. So I untarred the ctwm-3.7.tar.gz file on a
machine running FC4, followed the instructions up to xmkmf, which
created a Makefile. I copied the whole lot to my laptop running FC5,
then ran 'make', and 'make install', which gave me my much needed ctwm.
<p>
You can normally fetch the latest version of ctwm from
<blockquote>
    <a href="http://ctwm.free.lp.se/dist/">http://ctwm.free.lp.se/dist/</a>
</blockquote>
I have made available a version of the tar file that
includes the Makefile created using the default settings for
Imakefile.local. It can be fetched (about 1.1Mb)
<a href="ctwm-3.7+Makefile.tar.gz">here</a>. If you untar it and type
'make' it should produce a usable version of ctwm. Run 'make install'
to install it. To make the man file available copy ctwm.man to
/usr/local/man/man1.
<p>
There are many web sites giving sample versions of .ctwmrc to
produce different sorts of 'Look and feel' with ctwm, e.g.

<h3><b>
UPDATE 30 Aug 2006: Playing DVDs and Music CDs
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
For some time I was not been able to play DVDs on my Dell D610,
whether using FC3 or FC5. It turns out that that's because I had been using the command
<pre>
    gmplayer /dev/dvd
</pre>

which used to work on my old laptop. However, I've just looked at the
mplayer man file and noticed for the first time that I was giving the
wrong command! It should have been

<pre>
    gmplayer dvd://
</pre>

So I can play dvds OK -- Not that I need to often, but I had just got a
dvd containing a video recording a lecture I wanted to listen to.
<p>
Like one of my colleagues I was not able to play music CDs using linux
on the D610 or on my desktop machine using FC4, without first copying
the files using cdparanoia and then using play, or gmplayer -- until I
learnt about alsamixer !
<p>
When I ran it on my desktop pc I found far more options than I had
previously thought existed and one of them seemed to toggle the CD
input. That enabled me to use cdp to play a music CD.
<p>
Then I did more investigation and found that gnome-cd would play a cd.
<p>
On the Dell D610 I had more difficulty. alsamixer did not seem to do
anything to make cds play, but I did some exploring and found kscd.
<p>
<blockquote>
The kcsd tool has an 'Extras' button. One of the options it provides
is 'configure kscd'.
<p>
One of the options that provides is "use direct digital
playback".
<p>
I selected the 'alsa' backend, clicked on 'Apply' and after
that CDs worked on my laptop with kscd.
</blockquote>
<p>
It seems that cdplayers can use either the analog input from the cd
device, using a cable that connects the device to the motherboard,
or else play directly using the digital source. But apparently
our linux systems were not set up to do the latter by default,
which seems to be required now on the D610.
<p>
I learnt a bit more here
    <a href="http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdemultimedia/kscd/ts-ddpback.html">http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdemultimedia/kscd/ts-ddpback.html</a>
<p>
Fortunately kscd works fine with ctwm: I don't need to run kde.
