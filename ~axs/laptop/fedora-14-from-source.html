<h3><b>
Notes on building a 2.6.36 kernel for Fedora 14
<br/>
<small>
This is a supplement to the file on using my Dell Latitude E6410 with Fedora:
<a href="laptop-linux">here.</a>
</small>
</b></h3>
I had previously installed F14, and had tried a 2.6.35 kernel (with
and without tuxonice) and could not get the graphic card to work
properly -- symptoms described below, e.g. booting with blank screen
unless I used nomodeset and the 'vesa' graphic driver in xorg.conf.
<p>
So
I downloaded the 2.6.36 kernel source (linux-2.6.36.tar.bz2)
<br/>
You may wish to use a newer one from
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/</a>
<p>
Untar the file (e.g. tar xjvf linux-2.6.36.tar.bz2)
<br/>
Get rid of the architectures you don't want, by putting this in a
bash script file and running it (I forget where I found it):

<pre>
  #!/bin/bash

  ## get rid of all but x86 architecture (alter for your system):
  ARCHDIRS="alpha blackfin h8300 m68knommu mn10300 s390 arm \
  cris m32r microblaze parisc sh avr32 frv ia64 m68k mips \
  powerpc sparc xtensa score"

  echo -n "deleting"
  for DIR in $ARCHDIRS; do
      echo -n " $DIR"
      rm -rf arch/$DIR
  done

  echo " Documentation"
  rm -rf Documentation

  echo ""
  echo "creating Documentation Kbuild"
  mkdir -p Documentation/DocBook
  touch Documentation/Kbuild Documentation/DocBook/Kbuild
</pre>

Fetch my config file from here
 <a href="config-2.6.36-f14-new">config-2.6.36-f14-new</a>
<p>
then create your own .config file in the kernel directory:

<pre>
    cp config-2.6.36-f14-new .config
</pre>

Edit it to alter this line, which defines the kernel suffix, if you wish:
<pre>
    CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="f14-new"
</pre>

Then do this (which can take a long time and compile far more
modules than you need!)
<pre>
    make oldconfig
    ## alternatively 'make menuconfig' or 'make xconfig'
    ## as explained in the README file.
    make
    make modules_install
    make install
</pre>
This should create a new vmlinuz and other files in /boot (using the
suffix you provided in the .config file).
<p>
It wll also edit the /boot/grub/grub.conf (or menu.lst) file.
<p>
Check that file very carefully to make sure you know what it does.
<br>
If it contains a 'hiddenmenu' command, remove it so that you always
see the boot options.
<br/>
(The default in fedora is to hide the boot menu which is UTTERLY
stupid, especially for newcomers who wish to have fedora and a
previous installation of windows available.)
<p>
The 'default' line in grub.conf or menu.lst specifies which kernel
to boot into by default. E.g. 'default 0' means use the first one in
the list.
<p>
You might wish to make sure that the default is one that you know
works, until you have tried the new kernel to make sure it is
usable.
<p>
At the end of the kernel line starting:
<pre>
    kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.36f14-new
</pre>

I added these options, though I don't know if the last one is
necessary:
<pre>
    KEYTABLE=uk i915.modeset=1 video=card0-HDMI
</pre>

I also removed this file in the previously created /etc/X11
directory:
<pre>
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>
This system now seems to work fine using my preferred mode of
operation, namely booting into a text console, then using 'startx'
to go into graphic mode.
<p>
I can attach a monitor and run 'xrandr', but for some reason
'lxrandr' has stopped working in this configuration.
<p>
So to make the system detect and use an external display I use this
command:
<pre>
    xrandr --auto
</pre>
This kernel also allows me to use the SDHC card reader built into
the E5410, which I could not do with Fedora 13, using the
configuration described below.
<p>
This kernel does not include tuxonice (software suspend 2) but the
'pm-hibernate' command seems to work ok, though the display while
suspending and resuming is not as nice as tuxonice. When a tuxonice
kernel 2.6.37 or later for Fedora 14 becomes available, I'll
try that.
