Update 6 Jun 2009: xrandr on Fedora 10
<br/>
Revised: 14 Jun 2009
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Some time after I installed Fedora 10 on my laptop I started
noticing that if I tried to use an external projector the only
resolution I could get is 800x600, which was a pain. However, I
recently discovered that there is a grub boot option 'nomodeset'.
That seems to have fixed the problem.
<p>
Previously I wrote that I have tested it only on my Belinea monitor
not on a projector. However, last week I gave two talks in different
places and the xrandr command allowed me to use a resolution of
approximately 1200x1024 on two different projectors.
<p>
Unfortunately, however, the use of 'nomodeset' in the grub file
appears to have stopped 'vlc' showing videos through a projector.
So I have been suing gmplayer, which works except that I cannot
change the size of display, as I could with vlc.
<p>
If anyone knows how
to get vlc to display videos on an external projector, with
the 'nomodeset' option in the grub boot file, please let me know.
<p>
However the problem that vlc does not display videos on the external
screen remains, even though mplayer does display them. There should
be a simple fix?

<h3><b>
The Original problem
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
At first when I installed Fedora 8 on my laptop, it was somehow
configured to use a 'radeon' driver. I don't know where that came
from. As I was having problems with that, especially using
projectors connected to the laptop, I installed the proprietary
self-installing fglrx driver from the ATI linux web site as
described
<a href="d600-linux.html#install-ati">here (beware of possibly
out of
date instructions)</a>.
<p>
The fglrx driver worked very well for most purposes (including
running the 'glxgears' demo much more quickly than the previous
driver. However I continued having trouble getting it to work with
external displays or projectors. In particular, I typically could
not get the laptop to drive an external display unless I aborted the
running X11 system and restarted it with the VGA graphic
cable connected. Having to restart X was a serious nuisance after I
had prepared multiple desktops including demonstrations and videos
for a presentation.
<p>
I struggled to find a way to set up X11 so that I could connect an
external display without restarting X11. I eventually found that I
could meet various subsets of these conditions:
<ol>
<li>
with the X window system running I should be able to connect an
external monitor or projector.
<li>
the external display should be a 'clone' of what is on the screen,
as opposed to extending the screen with a separate display area.
<li>
the resolution of the external display should be 1280x1024 (which is
what my laptop is set to, though it can do 1400x1050).
<li>
I should not have to restart X after connecting, in order to get the
external display working.
</ol>
I seemed to be able to get any three of those conditions satisfied,
but never all of them!
<p>
I had heard about the wonders of xrandr, e.g.
<a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR">here</a>, and
found I had it installed, and tried using it to fix my external
display problems. However with the ATI fglrx driver the xrandr
commands did not seem to do everything they were supposed to do.
<p>
So I decided to go back to a driver packaged by Fedora developers.

<h3><b>
Solution using X.org ati driver and 'xrandr' utility.
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
After much struggling with solutions found on the internet which may
have worked for other systems but did not work for mine,
I stumbled on a reference to the 'ati' driver
that is available for Fedora, and works with the 'xrandr' utility
for manipulating internal and external displays when using X11.
<p>
It turned out that my Fedora 8 dvd had
this version of the ati driver:
<pre>
    xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.7.195-3.fc8.i386
</pre>
So I installed that (I am not sure why it was not included in my
original installation). After finding that it did the main things I
wanted and also seemed to be compatible with Software Suspend 2
(SWSUSP2, now called Tuxonice) described in
<a href="d600-linux.html">my main laptop web page</a>, I used
<pre>
    yum update xorg-x11-drv-ati
</pre>
to install the latest version, which turned out to be this:
<pre>
    xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.8.0-4.fc8
</pre>
<p>
I now find that I can set up my computer without connecting it to a
display, and when ready connect it to an external display, which now
works.
<p>
The command
<pre>
    xrandr -q
</pre>
prints out information about available displays and their available
resolutions.
<p>
I can also give this command (after connecting the graphic cable
from the projector):
<pre>
    xrandr --auto
</pre>
After that the display/projector works: no rebooting needed, and no
restarting of X11. It also clones the display at the right
resolution.
<p>
So far I have only tested this on an external LCD monitor.
I shall have the chance to test it with an external projector when I
give a
<a href="http://thegreatdebate.org.uk/UnnoticedConnections.html">talk in Newcastle</a>
on 21st October. After that event I'll report problems, if any.

<h3><b>
Using xrandr to change screen resolution quickly
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
There is a simple tutorial on xrandr in
<a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-resize-screen-size-quickly.html">http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-resize-screen-size-quickly.html</a>
<p>
E.g if you use the 'xrandr' command to find out the available
resolutions for your display, you can number them starting from 0
(corresponding to the default resolution), and use the number as a
parameter to specify the resolution to switch to.
<p>
E.g. this command will restore the default resolution
<pre>
    xrandr -s 0
</pre>
and if 1024x768 is the 5th resolution in the list then that can be
selected using
<pre>
    xrandr -s 5
</pre>
Note that it can take a second or two for the resolution to change.
<p>
If you choose a resolution that for some reason does not work, you
will have to type in the dark to get back to the original.

<h3><b>
Problem showing videos with the 'ati' driver.
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
There is an exception to my claim that 'xrandr' makes everything
work with the 'ati' driver, though not with the 'fglrx' driver.
<p>
The exception is that when I try using 'vlc' to display
movies/videos, they show up fine on my laptop screen, but the
display is blank (i.e. black) on the external screen.
<p>
Fortunately the problem goes away if I use 'gmplayer' instead of
'vlc'. I suspect that means that vlc can somehow be altered to do
the same as gmplayer.
