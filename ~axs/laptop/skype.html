This file is an extension to my
<a href="d600-linux.html">'Linux on Laptop' web site,</a>
although it is not strictly a linux problem (Windows and Mac users
also appear on web sites discussing Skype echo problems) nor a
laptop problem.
<p>
It seems that many people have problems with audio echo when
attempting to use Skype. This can have various causes and various
cures. See
<a href="http://www.skype.com/help/guides/soundsetup.html">http://www.skype.com/help/guides/soundsetup.html</a>
However the
<a href="http://www.skype.com/help/guides/soundsetup_linux.html">linux link from that page</a>
does not have the important information I found elsewhere (at least
it did not when I looked on 3 Nov 2007).
<p>
The most obvious cause of echo is a microphone picking up the sounds
coming from a nearby speaker. This should not occur if you are using
a headset. Other causes can be transmission problems on the
internet.
<p>
The problem I had was that I could use the skype test call service
and everything seemed fine. Other people I called said they had no
problem communicating with other skype users, though when talking to
me they kept hearing their own echo, and I found their sound levels
going up and down making it difficult to hear what they were saying.
<p>
It was clear from all the facts that the problem had something to do
with my audio settings. However when I ran alsamixer, kmix or
gnome-volume-control I could not find anything that looked wrong.
<p>
Eventually I found the solution here:
<a href="http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=23373">http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=23373</a>
<br>
The version of the solution for windows was:
<pre>
    1. Download the latest version of the realtek driver (important)
    2. double click on the windows speaker icon
    3. select playback properties
    4. MUTE the microphone in the playback section
    5. select recording properties
    6. SELECT the microphone in the recording section
</pre>

So I translated that for my situation, as follows:


<pre>
    1. run alsamixer
    2. set it to show playback
    3. turn off mic
    4. set it to show capture
    5. turn on mic
</pre>

After that when I tried talking to a colleague the echo problem had
gone. I hope this information is useful to others. I suspect the
alterations can also be made using kmix or gnome-volume-control but
have not checked.
