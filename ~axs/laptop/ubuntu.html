<h2><b>
Some Experiences with Ubuntu Gutsy and Wireless WPA
<br>
<small>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/">Aaron Sloman</a>

Updated: 12 Jan 2008
<p>
I have discovered how to get a wireless card based on the ralink
2500 driver working by preventing loading of the ra2500pci module
and starting up wireless using the latest version of the rutilt
tool.
<p>
Most of this may be equally relevant to other wireless devices
using ralink chipsets.
<p>
Instead of fetching the updated legacy rt2500
driver, as I did, you can try one of the other enhanced legacy
drivers listed here:

<h3><b>
The problem -- As of 5 Jan 2008
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>
The current situation regarding use of wireless on linux seems to be
a real mess, with new kernels using redesigned mechanisms for
wireless, and many (but not all) existing readily available drivers
only working with older kernels. This appears especially to have
clobbered people who installed the latest version of Ubuntu (Gutsy,
version 7.10) in the last few months, though it may also affect
users of some other versions of linux and perhaps users with older
installations running new kernels.

Because the situation is so messy and things are changing so
quickly, I have to warn readers that it may be hard for them to tell
whether the solution that worked for me will work for them, even if
they are using Ubuntu Gutsy version 7.10.

In my case, the problems described below, and the solution provided
below, concern this kernel on Ubuntu Gutsy:

    2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Tue Dec 18 08:02:57 UTC 2007

[To find out what kernel you are using you can search for command to
open a 'console window' (e.g. xterm) which, stupidly, is not one of
the defaults on the Ubuntu panel when it starts up. Having opened
such a window you can type 'uname -rv' to get something like the
above. If the date of your kernel is earlier than Dec 18th, or if
the third number is below 22 or the fourth is below 14 it is very
likely none of this will work for you. If the numbers are higher, it
may or may not work. If you configured and compiled the kernel
sources yourself instead of using a 'standard' Ubuntu Gutsy kernel,
that can change many things.]

I found several web sites offering advice saying 'doing so and so
worked for me', followed by comments from grateful readers for whom
it worked and others for whom it did not work.

One problem is that there are many people (including me) who find it
difficult to know what the dependencies are so that they cannot
decide what to specify regarding the system on which something
worked. E.g. they may specify 'Ubuntu Gutsy', but not know that the
kernel in use, or some other feature of their installation, can make
a difference to what works.

In contrast there are experts who know a lot about what is going on,
but have no idea what it is like to be a 'newbie'. So they tell
enquirers to do things that many newcomers will not be able to make
any sense of. E.g. saying 'use man to get more information' to
someone who recently converted from Windows will not normally convey
any useful information.

No doubt everything will catch up in a few months but, judging by
the number of complaints/confusion/out of date advice etc. that I
have found on the web, this is likely to do the reputation of linux
a lot of harm. Already I've seen a number of messages from
disgruntled users saying they are going back to windows, alas.

Of course, this does not affect people who are still using older
versions of debian, ubuntu, fedora, etc.

And it does not seem to affect users of intel integrated wireless
systems, presumably because of all the help Intel give the linux
community (they see a potentially large market, especially for
education in poorer countries, I think). E.g. my Dell Latitude D610
with Intel ipw2200 wireless card works perfectly with different
flavours of WPA, on Fedora 7 as described <a href="wpa">here</a>

The rationale behind this mess is explained here
    <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_24#head-62e9ebf067c978bbf70898986c0aa3904d1a3543">http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_24#head-62e9ebf067c978bbf70898986c0aa3904d1a3543</a>
The technical aims seem to be excellent, and the public-relations a
serious disaster.

<h3><b>
My configuration - and problem history with Ubuntu Gutsy
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Hardware for Ubuntu PC:</b>
    2001 vintage PC with AMD Duron 750 Mhz cpu, 780MH RAM

    Belkin F5D7000 Wireless G PCI card (up to 54Mb/sec rating)
    With chipset: RaLink RT2500 802.11g Cardbus/mini-PCI (rev 01)

<b>I also use two other machines:</b>
I normally use Fedora for my work at home: Fedora 6 on my desktop PC
and Fedora 7 on my Dell Laptop, both of which work fine, as
described <a href="index.html">here</a>

<b>Wireless router</b>
At home I have a Dlink DI512 wireless router, connected to a Virgin
media (blueyonder) cable modem providing a 20Mbit/sec download
connection (only 750Kbit/sec upload).

This is one floor up in a front room of the house. It has four
ethernet sockets, currently used to enable two PCs to be permanently
connected using cable (mine running Linux, close to the router, and
my wife's, unfortunately, running Windows XP at the end of a long
cable running to the back of the house, on the ground floor). Both
connections work very well all the time. I can also temporarily
connect one or two other machines using the two spare sockets on the
router.

The router is set to use WPA-PSK and my laptop connects to it by
wireless, using wpa_supplicant. Wpa_supplicant automatically
switches between two different modes for home and university use.
It works well anywhere in the house and in the garden.

<b>Transfer speeds</b>
Of course, I cannot normally achieve 20Mbit/sec downloads, because
of limitations of other portions of the route, but occasionally
download speeds do peak very close to that speed.

Even my laptop manages to get close to 17Mbit/sec downloads using a
wireless connection, when it is in the same room as the router. At
the back of the house (where the Ubuntu PC is) the maximum speed can
drop to about 14Mbit/sec.

<b>Why the Ubuntu machine?</b>
I wanted experience using Ubuntu, in order to decide whether to
switch from Fedora (as recommended by several colleagues), so, since
I am not superstitious and Christmas is of no interest to me, and
25th December was a nice peaceful day here, I used it to install the
latest version of Ubuntu on an old PC previously used by my wife,
located in a back bedroom, with no cable connection available.
Instead it has a wireless PCI card (details belwow).

<b>Problems getting wireless working on Gutsy</b>
During and after the Ubuntu Gutsy installation from CD, the wireless
connection did not work, so I moved the PC temporarily to the room
with the router, connected it using a cable, and managed to complete
the installation, including upgrading the kernel and various other
things.

At that point the wireless card worked, but not with WPA, only with
a 128 bit WEP key, which does not provide adequate protection. So I
returned it to the back room. However, it was terribly slow, never
achieving transfer speeds of more than about 750 Kbit/sec, whereas
the laptop could go more than 10 times as fast, even when sitting
next to it in the back room.

Eventually, after trying various remedies suggested on the <a href="http://sb.lug.org.uk/">local
linux user group</a> and many more found by reading 'how to' files
found with google's help, or answers offered in online forum
messages, mostly concerned with problems reported by Ubuntu users, I
found a configuration that worked with WPA, provided that I set the
router not to conceal its ESSID. But speed was not improved at all.

The first version of this web site (28th December 2007) reported how
I had used wpa_supplicant to set up the connection on the ubuntu
machine. That worked for a couple of days, then one morning when I
booted up the machine I could no longer get wireless to work, either
with WEP or WPA, no matter what I did. I still have no idea what I
had changed to produce that effect.

Only several days later (early morning on 5th Jan 2008), after very
carefully reading web sites concerning changes to wireless support
on linux, did I manage to find a way to get the connection working
again, as described below, and this time at a much better speed,
though not quite as fast as the laptop, possibly because the PCI
card has its aerial very close to the case, with a number of cables
nearby.

The solution, described below, is specific to wireless cards using
the same chipset as mine. Some aspects of the solution may
generalise to other wireless adapters, however.

<h3><b>
The solution, using latest ralink rt2500 linux driver
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>

I did all the following in an 'xterm' window, as superuser, by
typing into the window:

    sudo su
<small><ol><li>I used the 'synaptic' command run directly in the xterm window to
invoke the package manager, and used that to deinstall 'network-manager'.

(You may prefer to invoke it from a menu.)

<li>Compiling the legacy module:

I followed the instructions on the serialmonkey web site:

    http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads

in the 'Enhanced legacy drivers' web site to fetch the latest
'tarball'
    http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/rt2500-cvs-daily.tar.gz

I saved that in /usr/local/src/rt2500 and untarred it
    tar xfz rt2500-cvs-daily.tar.gz

That produced a directory rt2500-cvs-2008010203. One of the
subdirectories was 'Module'. I used 'cd' to enter that subdirectory,
and read the README and TESTING files. 'make' and 'make install'
worked OK, but the instruction to go to the Utility directory
(actually called 'Utilitys') to make RaConfig2500 proved to be
out of date: there was nothing there to make.

NOTE: I did not use the  Next-generation rt2x00 drivers because the
instructions suggested that in order to use them it would be
necesary to fetch and compile the latest kernel, which I did not
wish to do.

<li>Checking the module installation:

I then found that 'make install' had copied the file rt2500.ko in
the directory
    /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/extra

leaving the old version in this directory, which was rather silly:

    /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless

So I renamed the version in the latter directory as
    old-rt2500.ko

and copied the version from the 'extra' directory

    cp -p rt2500.ko /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless

(I wonder how many Ubuntu users found that the instructions they had
followed failed because the old module was left in place?)

<li>I then fetched compiled and installed the RutilT utility which
replaces the no longer supported RaConfig2500 file. I downloaded it
from here
    http://cbbk.free.fr/bonrom/

The latest version is:
    http://cbbk.free.fr/bonrom/?download=RutilTv0.16.tar.gz

That was unpacked as usual

    tar xfz RutilTv0.16.tar.gz

produced a directory RutilTv0.16. I used 'cd' to enter it, and tried
to follow the instructions.

Running ./configure.sh as instructed produced an error message

    'Please install (or upgrade to) GTK+ 2.6.0, at least.'

Eventually, after wasting a lot of time trying to upgrade a package
that did not need upgrading I decided that the syntax in the
config.sh file was wrong, so I used a text editor to comment out
these lines, using '#':

    # if ! pkg-config  --print-errors --exists 'gtk+-2.0 >= 2.6.0'; then
    #     echo 'Please install (or upgrade to) GTK+ 2.6.0, at least.'
    #     exit 1
    # fi

    (I don't know enough to change the syntax to make it do what it is
    supposed to do. But I ran

        pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0

    and that printed out

        2.12.0

    so I clearly had a more up to date version than 2.6.0.)

After that, 'config.sh' ran perfectly, creating Makefile_cst

<b>NOTE ADDED 12 Jan 2008</b>
    After correspndence with the author of RutilT I've investigated
    the above and cannot replicate the problem with configure.sh
    There may have been some temporary problem with configuration of
    libraries on my machine. The problem may not afffect anyone
    else.

After that I ran 'make' and 'make install' to compile and install
the files. It informed me what it was doing:

    Installing rutilt in /usr/local/bin/
    Installing rutilt_helper in /usr/local/bin/
    Installing set_ip.sh in /usr/local/share/apps/rutilt/
    Installing arts
    Installing rutilt.desktop in /usr/local/share/applications/
    Installing manual pages in /usr/local/share/man/man1

I read the man file using
    'man rutilt'

<li>Following advice I had read somewere I blacklisted a no longer
required module. Using a text editor, I added

    blacklist rt2500pci

at the end of this fil:

    /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

<li>Various failed experiments showed me that 'wpa-supplicant' would
not work with this configuration, so I edited the file

    /etc/network/interfaces

so that it contained only
<small>
    iface lo inet loopback
    auto lo

    iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.1.8
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1

    iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    mode managed
    wireless-essid default
</small>
I did not include either 'auto eth1' or 'auto wlan0', to give me the
option to bring up either the cable connection or the wireless
connection.

<li>Setting the router.

I set the router to use WPA-PSK and typed a key that did not contain
any common words of English. I also set it to recognise the MAC
address of my wireless interface and use dhcp always to give it the
address 192.168.1.8 (so that other machines could always use the
same abbreviation for it).

<li>Rebooting and restarting:

After all that I rebooted the PC. Because I had set ubuntu to start
up in non graphical mode I could see warning messages and found that
the firewall complained about not finding wlan0, but it turned out
that that did not matter.

You may prefer to follow the instructions in 'man rutilt' to do
something different from what I did, but this is what worked for me.
I am sure there is a more elegant way to proceed.

After rebooting I started my window manager (ctwm, which I much
prefer to gnome or kde) and in that opened an xterm window (which
you can do in any linux window manager).

I then did the following to restart the networking and bring up the
wireless interface:

    /etc/init.d/networking restart

Then bring up the wireless interface.

    ifup wlan0

This attempts to connect to the wireless access point but fails.
In another xterm window I typed

    sudo rutilt

This brings up the rutilt graphical tool. One of the buttons is
'site survey'. I clicked on that. It showed my access point and
a couple of neighbouring access points. It showed that my access
point used WPAPSK and TKIP.

I selected that access point and clicked on 'Add profile' That
brought up a window into which I could type a name for the profile,
and the WPA key. Fortunately it allows you to see what you are
typing. After I clicked 'ok' that profile was also shown if I
clicked on the 'Profiles' button.

Selecting the profile and clicking on 'connect' started up the
connection, and everything worked after that.

However, there is NO button to save the profile. (Why not??)

So after much experimentation I found that by giving the command

    sudo killall -q rutilt

I killed the window (though the wireless connection remained
working) and I had a profile saved in this directory

    ~/.config/rutilt/

Actually two files were created there. The one with the profiles is
called: RutilT_profiles.xml

<li>Using the saved profile.

I did not want to have to bring up the graphical tool every time to
start the network, and found that there is a shell command to do it

    rutilt wlan0 -d -p <profilename> -e

(Read 'man rutilt' to find out more.)

However I could not find a way to run a shell script a boot time to
start the network, run 'ifup wlan0' and run rutilt.

If someone can tell me how, I'll add the information here.

The previous method of starting up the wireless connection using
wpa_supplicant, described below, was much simpler, but with that
wireless card I could not get it to work at a reasonable speed.

Earlier version of this file -- indicating confusions

<p>
Update: 31 Dec 2007
<br>
<p>
<pre>
Note: Since I started this web site I have discovered that the main
cause of the speed problems described below is not so much Ubuntu
Gutsy as the use of a particular wireless card whose linux driver is
still under development and which is not totally compatible with
most recent kernels. This could therefore affect other
distributions.
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
This is a modified version of a message sent to the <a href="https://mailman.lug.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/sb">Birmingham Linux
User Group</a> on Fri, 28 Dec 2007 reporting on my attempts to a WPA
wireless connection working on the latest Ubuntu (Gutsy, version 7.10).

I normally run Fedora (version 6 on my PC, version 7 on my laptop), as
described <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop">here</a>.

I have elsewhere described how I got my laptop to <a href="wpa">work with a
WPA wireless connection.</a>

But I wanted to test Fedora 8, and also to try out Ubuntu, so I used an
old 2001 vintage PC with 750 mhz AMD Duron CPU. It is kept in a room
that is too far for a wireless connection to my router, so I wanted it
to work with its wireless card:

    Belkin F5D7000

Reported by lspci as using this controller:

    Network controller: RaLink RT2500 802.11g Cardbus/mini-PCI (rev 01)

For which which many ubuntu users have reported problems recently, e.g.
here

    <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.22/+bug/134660">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.22/+bug/134660</a>

I did eventually get this working, as described below, but my laptop
runs the same wireless connection 10 times as fast (using the Intel
IPW2200 wireless device, which is now very well supported on linux).

Using the Belkin wireless card, I get a transmission speed of about
1.5 mb/sec within a couple of meters of the access point, and the
laptop does about 16 mb/sec. In the remote room the laptop drops to
about 14mb/sec and the Belkin card drops to about 770kb/sec, a 50%
reduction, which is just about tolerable for web browsing but very
slow for downloading upgrades, etc. I got the same speed with Fedora
8, so I assume the problem is the wireless card not the drivers.
(Note this: is download file transfer speed. This speed problem is
different from a problem some other Ubuntu users have reported
regarding slow internet contact when using a browser, because of
NDS problems.)

<b>Getting the card working at all</b>
Anyhow the rest of this message reports the saga of getting it working
with Ubuntu. None of this difficulty occurred with Fedora 8: I just
typed in the essid, the passphrase, told it to use WPA-PSK, and it
worked, but very slowly (by comparison with the laptop nearby).
But getting it to work at all with WPA on Ubuntu required much more
work, partly because I was led up several false trails.

<b>WPA on UBUNTU: my journey</b>
I found many people on ubuntu web sites complaining about problems with
WPA in recent releases of Ubuntu, and many suggestions as to how to deal
with the problems. Most of them proved a complete waste of time for me.

E.g. One of them suggested deinstalling and blacklisting the current
driver:

    rt2500pci

and installing an older one

    rt2500

which I had to fetch and compile. However that did not work for me, and
seemed to be incompatible with the other modules needed, as shown by

    $ lsmod | grep rt2500
    rt2500pci              19072  0
    rt2x00pci              11520  1 rt2500pci
    rt2x00lib              19584  2 rt2500pci,rt2x00pci
    mac80211              171016  4
    rc80211_simple,rt2500pci,rt2x00pci,rt2x00lib
    eeprom_93cx6            3200  1 rt2500pci

The other required modules could not be installed using only the
rt2500 module, and I could not use the wireless connection at all.

So I reverted to the rt2500pci module and explored other avenues.

One respondent to my message to the Birminghum LUG suggsted a change to
the file: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

    blacklist ipv6

But that proved unnecessary for my problems.

I can't remember all the things I tried -- in vain. I wasted many hours
following tips from many sources (not one of my more productive
experiences with google).

That included getting rid of network-manager and installing WICD. The
latter looks nice, but proved useless in my situation.

In fact I found both WICD and the nm-applet less useful than wpa_gui, as
<a href="#wpagui">explained below.</a>

<b>Passphrase? Which passphrase?</b>
One of the problems I had in my long journey was unclear instructions
regarding the difference between the user's passphrase, and the
passphrase generated by the command

    wpa_passphrase <i>essid</i> <i>passphrase</i>

In some contexts you need the *original* passphrase (e.g. typing into
GUI interfaces or in the wpa_supplicant config file entry

     psk="myverycleverpassphrase"

In other contexts, e.g. if you leave out the quote marks in the above
entry you need the *generated* passphrase which might look like this

    psk=53996a9fbb45ed78bd0be12616bb1f7ff34e27bcd8cd4c04f240a64ce17d52c8

Some people don't bother to tell you such things when they write their
'how to' files.

The solution I adopted below did not use the generated passphrase.

Another thing not usually mentioned is that if you choose a
passphrase for your wireless access point using WPA it should be as
long as possible, up to maximum of 63 characters, and should be as
random as possible. Steve Gibson provides a good generator of random
passphrases:
    <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm">https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm</a>

If you wish to use a WPA passphrase that is short enough for you to
memorise, do some research on current 'cracking' technology. I
believe that at present (December 2007) a passphrase whose length is
in the high 20s and is not composed of words in a dictionary is
likely to be safe for a while. I've built a memorable passphrase
made of place names with some numbers interspersed, which is
probably OK for now.

The requirement for security is probably lower if you live in a low
density area -- e.g. single occupancy houses with large gardens and
wide streets. If you live in an apartment block or in a city centre,
with lots of cars parked nearby, take more care.

<b>Making the Access Point's ESSID visible</b>
It turns out that some systems find it hard to connect to WPA wireless
services that don't make the ESSID visible. One of the things I had to
do was make mine visible. Only after doing that could I find out that
the wireless card had detected the access point, using this command:

    iwlist scanning

or, specifying my wireless card

    iwlist wlan0 scanning

[Making the ESSID visible was not necessary for Fedora 8 to make the WPA
connection.]

<b>Making the Wireless card work with WPA on Ubuntu</b>
Anyhow, eventually, after many detours and wasted hours I found a
*very* simple solution that works very well, <a href="http://comphobby.org/archives/14-More-Ubuntu-WPA-PSK-From-A-Joe-Sixpack-Perspective.html">on this web page.</a>

My version of the advice found there is as follows.

STEP 1
    In the file (which <i>could</i> be located elsewhere -- see below):

        /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

    create something like this:

        ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

        ap_scan=1

        network={
             ssid="default"
             scan_ssid=1
             key_mgmt=WPA-EAP WPA-PSK IEEE8021X
             pairwise=CCMP TKIP
             psk="yourchosenpassphraseinoriginalform"
        }

    In fact the key_mgmt line could probably be shortened to use
    just the WPA-PSK option if that's what your access point provides.

    Note: the wpa_supplicant.conf file can have different entries for
    different networks using WPA, identified using different 'ssid' names.

    E.g. on my laptop running fedora 7 I use one wpa_supplicant.conf
    file and include entries for my home network and for the campus
    network.
        <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/wpa">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/laptop/wpa</a>

STEP 2

    In the file

        /etc/network/interfaces

    insert something like this (excluding my comments), modified to fit your
    context. Note that 'iface <name>' starts an entry for an interface.
    A separate line 'auto <name>' specifies whether the interface should
    be started up when networking starts. The 'iface' line can end with
    'static' for fixed address interfaces or 'dhcp' for others.

    ## Part 1 of file:
    ## I think this bit may be unnecessary

        iface lo inet loopback
        auto lo

    ## Part 2 of file for wired connection: eth1 in my case
    ## Something like this tells the system that you have a wired
    ## connection (eth1 here). In my case I can't use it most of the time,
    ## so I don't include the line 'auto eth1'.
    ## If I move the machine closer to my router I can connect a cable and
    ## use 'ifup eth1' instead of the wireless connection, which is how I got
    ## started setting the machine up

        iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.1.8
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.1.1
    ### (or whatever your addresses are)

    ## Part 3 of file, for wireless connection, using wlan0
    ## While experimenting I commented out the 'auto wlan0'
    ## so that I could switch easily between the two interfaces.
    ## But reinstated it for the final version, as follows:

        auto wlan0

        iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        wpa-ssid default
        wpa-ap-scan 1
        pre-up /sbin/wpa_supplicant -Bw -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant


    ### Note that the 'pre-up' line runs wpa_supplicant using the 'wext'
    ### driver, and specifies the config file. So you can locate it
    ### in a different place if you wish.

    ### Note that for a different wireless device you may have to replace
    ### -Dwext with -D<something else> to fit your driver, and you may have
    ### to replace -iwlan0 with -i<something else>

    ### End of contents of 'interfaces' file

STEP 3: setup up access point

    I told my Wireless router (DLINK DI-524) the mac address of wlan0 and
    specified under static dhcp connectoins that it should use the same IP
    address for this PC as when the machine is connected by wire, so that
    the rest of the network recognises it as the same machine, whether I use
    the wire connection or the wireless connection.

STEP 4: TESTING

    Test the system, with 'auto wlan0' commented out, to allow better
    observation of what's going on. In my case I had temporarily moved
    the computer so that I could use a cable connection, and was switching
    between wlan0 and eth1 using ifup and ifdown, until I had everything
    working.

    If you are not already typing as root, prefix everything with
    'sudo'. (I prefer to do 'sudo su' then work as root.)

    Turn networking off then on again with this command

        /etc/init.d/networking restart

    Turn on wireless device (needed because 'auto' line removed):

        /sbin/ifup wlan

    You'll get quite a lot of stuff printed out.

    In my case I got this, though some of the detail is there only because I
    had previously run wpa_supplicant:

    > root@ubuntu:/etc/network# ifup wlan0
    > ioctl[SIOCSIWAUTH]: Operation not supported
    > WEXT auth param 4 value 0x0 - ioctl[SIOCSIWAUTH]: Operation not supported

    > cannot override it
    > Delete '/var/run/wpa_supplicant/wlan0' manually if it is not used anymore
    > Failed to initialize control interface '/var/run/wpa_supplicant'.
    > You may have another wpa_supplicant process already running or the file was
    > left by an unclean termination of wpa_supplicant in which case you will need

    I have not been able to get any useful information about the
    ioctl 'Operation not supported' report. But it does not seem to matter.

    If you don't get the DHCPDISCOVER lines, it may be necessary in another
    window to type:

        dhclient wlan0

    Anyhow the crucial indication of success is the line

    > bound to 192.168.1.8 -- renewal in 476966 seconds.

    Running wpa_gui shows the state of the connection. If you don't
    get a connection, you may find it useful to explore what's going on.

    (I think 'apt-get wpa_gui' should fetch and install it: I don't know
    why it is not included automatically, as wpa_cli is).

STEP 5: finalise configuration

    If everything works, uncomment the line 'auto wlan0', and check that
    the wireless connection starts up OK when the network starts

        /etc/init.d/networking restart

    That worked for me first time with the above configuration of
    these two files

        /etc/network/interfaces
        /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

    Then to make sure, I tried rebooting, and when Ubuntu came up
    the wireless connection was working fine. No need to mess around with
    network manager or other obscure tools.

    Incidentally, I've defined an alias in /root/.bashrc

        alias network='/etc/init.d/networking'

    So I can just type things like

        networking restart

    (or 'stop', 'start').

    I still have not worked out how to configure the firewall, but I guess
    that's somewhere in the system-->administration menu.

<b>Ubuntu vs Fedora</b>
This has been a long and very tedious learning experience. I still don't
know whether I should switch from Fedora to Ubuntu on my main machines.

I have now found out how to make Ubuntu come up in text mode, and to
show me what it is doing while booting up or shutting down, which I
much prefer to watching a horizontal line grow:

    Remove 'quiet' and 'splash' from the kernel line after End Default
    Options in /boot/grub/menu.lst

Also to get a text login prompt rather than a graphical login window
do this as root, or using 'sudo'

    update-rc.d -f gdm remove

After logging in you can start x manually using 'startx', and
control what happens using the file ~/.xinitrc if you don't want the
default window manager. (That's what I also do on Fedora, CentOS,
etc.)

As far as I can see the main advantage in Ubuntu is that it makes it
slightly easier to install things that are not part of the core,
e.g. mplayer. But Fedora has also improved a lot.

Also the Debian 'synaptic' package manager is streets ahead of the
redhat/fedora 'pup' (at least when I last tried it).

That may be the single thing that persuades me to convert!

However, I have the impression that when I need advice on Fedora
it is easier to find useful and authorative answers to the
questions on the web.

Moreover, when I tried hibernate on Ubuntu it did not work, for
still unknown reasons, whereas I've got hibernate working perfectly
(and fast) using the 'Hensler' SWSUSP2 kernels with Fedora on my
laptop and desktop machines.

<a name="wpagui"></a>
<b>Digression on wpa_gui</b>
For graphical configuration the wpa_gui tool, which does not come by
default with ubuntu but can be fetched, seems to be more useful (as I
had previously found when setting up WPA on Fedora a couple of years
ago). It works only when wpa_supplicant has started up, but then gives
lots of useful information, and makes it easy to experiment with
different configurations. There are some screenshots here:

    <a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/wpa_gui.html">http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/wpa_gui.html</a>

The main panel reports progress on the currently selected or default
connection. It can be used to bring up a scan panel showing available
networks. Double clicking on one of those brings up an 'edit' panel
enabling you to edit the configuration. You can also use File-->edit to
edit the currently selected configuration. You can easily create
different configurations for the same access point and flip between them
while finding out what works, etc. I found this more useful when I was
simply getting WEP to run than WPA.

The main use of wpa_gui in my case was informing me what stage had been
reached when things were not working.
