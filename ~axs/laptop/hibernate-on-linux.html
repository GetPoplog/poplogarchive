Update 10 Dec 2014:
Everything works on my laptop using Fedora 20 (F20, FC20)
<br/>
I should have updated this file some time ago. Hibernate and suspend have been
working fine for months. I use pm-hibernate and pm-suspend. I stopped using
tuxonice months ago, as I could not get it to work, and it did not seem to have
any advantages apart from a slightly prettier display during hibernate and thaw.
<p>
I also use hibernate and suspend without problems on my Desktop PC running
Fedora 19 (F19).

Update 20 Oct 2012:
Improved solution using Tuxonice with Fedora 17 (FC17) on Laptop
</b></h3>
Thanks to help from Matthias Hensler
(<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php</a>)
I now have a much better solution on my Dell Latitude E6410 than the
one described in the <a href="#workaround">workaround below</a>.
<p>
The new method uses the latest
Fedora 17 (FC17) Tuxonice kernel, with the hibernate-tuxonice and
dracut-tuxonice utilities, all downloadable from:
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php">http://mhensler.de/swsusp/download_en.php</a>
and available in his yum repository:
<br/>
<a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/repository_en.php">http://mhensler.de/swsusp/repository_en.php</a>
<p>
However, it requires editing /etc/hibernate/tuxonice.conf to set
<pre>
    UseTuxOnIce "no"
</pre>
and thereafter hibernating with the 'hibernate' command, not
'pm-hibernate'. The edit in tuxonice.conf only needs to be done
once, after installing hibernate-tuxonice.
<p>
Exactly why that is required to allow resume/thaw after hibernate
always to succeed remains a mystery to be investigated.
<p>
The great advantage of this method, compared with the best
alternative described below, is that it does not require a copy of
grub.cfg to be edited after each kernel upgrade, and it does not
require hibernate to be run with a special script that temporarily
replaces grub.cfg, and restores the old value after resume.
<p>
It also does not require the boot flag 'maxcpus=1' for resume, which
could presumably affect speed.

<ul>
<li>
Using Fedora version 16 on Viglen Genie Desktop PC with Intel Core i5
<br/>
<b>Kernel</b> 3.3.7-1.fc16.i686 #1 SMP Tue May 22 14:14:30 UTC 2012
<br/>
pm-hibernate (to swap partition) and resume working perfectly provided
that for resume I alter grub.cfg to include maxcpus=1, as described
<a href="#workaround">below.</a>
<br/>
No reboot on PC needed
since 8th June. Over 150 hibernate/resume cycles since last reboot.
<br/>
I could have used this stable solution on the laptop but instead have
been trying different F17 kernels to see if I can help track down
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=862475">
the resume bug.</a>
<p>
<li>
Using Fedora version 17 on Dell Latitude E6410 laptop with Intel Core i5
<br/>
<b>Kernel</b> 3.6.1-1.fc17.i686 (October 2012)
<br/>
pm-hibernate (to swap partition) and resume working perfectly provided
that for resume I alter grub.cfg to include maxcpus=1.
<br/>
Experiments to find out exactly why maxcpus=1 helps by temporarily
adding debug print commands to the kernel are reported from comment #22
(thanks to much help from Bojan Smojver):
<br/>
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=862475">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=862475</a>
<br/>
Upshot so far: resume from hibernate sometimes succeeds and sometimes
fails, after successfully decompressing the saved image from swap
partition. My tests ruled out a possible bug in multi-threaded
decompression.
<p>
So the problem is still a mystery, but a totally reliable
work-around seems to be use of boot parameter 'maxcpus=1' in grub.cfg
before resuming. At present this requires two versions of grub.cfg, one
for full reboot, and one for resume. Only the latter has the extra boot
parameter included. (There should be a way to make it unnecessary to use
different grub.cfg files for booting and resuming.)
<p>
A usable but messy way to automate this is described in
<a href="#workaround">the work around section</a>
below.

<h3><b>
Introduction: Suspend and Hibernate
</b></h3>
Linux provides two ways of saving the process state on a computer and
then restoring it later on, with the computer powered down (mostly) in
the intervening period:
<ul>
<li>
suspend (state saved in RAM)
<li>
hibernate (state saved on hard drive).
</ul>
<p>
I shall describe command-line utilities since those are what I use. Your
system may give you menu options to activate suspend or hibernate. In
order to use my method described below you will need either to use the
command line or change one of your menus to invoke the commands
described here.
<p>
The two options for saving the state are:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Suspend (to RAM):</b> The current state of the machine is frozen in
memory but everything else is turned off, so that the amount of power
required is very small. In this mode, a laptop might take several days
to drain its battery instead of taking several hours as might be the
case with the machine running normally.
<p>
The command 'pm-suspend' is the default command for initiating a suspend
(to RAM) process . Whether this works for you on linux can depend on the
hardware you are using as explained in
<a href="http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-computing/articles/9738.aspx">http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-computing/articles/9738.aspx</a>
<p>
I shall say no more about use of pm-suspend as I use only the
next alternative: suspend to hard drive.
<p>
<li>
<b>Suspend to hard drive (often called Hibernate):</b>
The current state of the machine is saved on a hard drive, usually in
the swap area. Then the machine powers down completely, so that the
state can be saved without using any power for
weeks or months.
<p>
The default command for achieving this is 'pm-hibernate'. However, if
you install tuxonice on your machine, as described in
<a href="http://tuxonice.net/">http://tuxonice.net/</a>,
the command is replaced by 'hibernate'. I used tuxonice for several
years on a succession of Dell laptops but after I acquired a Dell
Latitude E6410 in June 2010, with integrated intel graphics I started
having difficulties concerned with the Video module i915 (and its
predecessor), required for use with the intel graphics card.
<p>
Later I switched to pm-hibernate which I eventually got to work as
described below. Many users have reported problems with i915 and either
(pm-)hibernate or suspend. The solution I have found now seems to work
very reliably for me. I am describing it here in the hope that others
may find this useful. It is not ideal, but it does seem to be reliable.
<p>
As explained above, on the laptop I have also tried running without this
workaround on an experimental kernel, to try to locate the bug.
<p>
</ul>
<a name="problems"></a>
<h3><b>
Two problems
</b></h3>
For a while there were two problems with attempts to use pm-hibernate on
machines with Intel integrated graphics and the i915 graphical module.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Problem 1 - hibernating sometimes freezing (now fixed):</b>
<br/>
For several months during 2011 and the early part of 2012 the hibernate
process had a serious bug that intermittently prevented the hibernation
process from completing: Instead the machine would start to hibernate,
and then go into a frozen state and a forced reboot was then necessary
(holding down the power button for a few seconds).
<p>
<b>
The hibernate failing problem was
fixed, at least for users of Fedora 16, by the end of March 2012, in
kernel 3.3. See
<br/>
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=785384">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=785384</a>
</b>
<p>
Since then hibernation has been very reliable and very fast on my 4-core
Intel core-i5 cpu, on both laptop and desktop PC.
<br/>
The process takes advantage of multiple CPUs to do
the compression of the image being written to the hard drive in several
parallel streams. I have not encountered hibernate freezing since the
end of March 2012.
<p>
However, the other problem, resume failing, remains.
<p>
<a name="restart"></a>
<b>23 Jul 2012 Warning about dual-boot installations:</b>
<br/>
if you switch between linux and windows, don't use 're-start' or
're-boot' in windows to return to linux as that stops hibernate
working. Instead shut down completely from windows, then power up, then
select linux.
<br/>
<b>Update 14 Oct 2012:</b> This turned out to be a side effect of using
'acpi=off' in grub.cfg to allow resume from pm-hibernate. I have not
checked whether that problem remains since switching to use of
'maxcpus=1' instead.
<p>
<li>
<b>Problem 2 - resuming sometimes causes rebooting (temporary workaround
available):</b>
<br/>
Many linux users (and some Windows users!) have
reported that the resume process does not complete after
hibernate (suspend to hard drive). See, for example:
<br/>

</small>
<p>
In my case the process gets very close to completion, but just as the
display should switch to the mode it was in before hibernating occurred,
the machine crashes and initiates a reboot.
<p>
This does not happen every time. When I try using pm-hibernate several
times in succession, resume may or may not complete successfully.
<p>
The rest of this file describes a workaround.
</ul>
<a name="workaround"></a>
<h3><b>
A work-around I can live with till the bug is fixed
</b></h3>
Searching for reports from fellow-sufferers I found several tips for
coping with hibernate problems, none of which helped except the
suggestion to add 'acpi=off' to the boot flags in the grub.cfg file.
Doing that allowed hibernate and resume to work, but it was not an
acceptable solution since too many things did not work, including screen
brightness adjustment.
<br/>
I later found that the problems were
reduced by using 'maxcpus=1' instead. But including that in grub.cfg
for normal boot was too restrictive as it prevented use of all four
cpus.
<p>
So I tried inserting two menu entries in the grub.cfg file, identical
except that one had maxcpus=1 and one did not. I used the one without for
booting the machine, but after hibernating I used the menu entry with
maxcpus=1 (which I set as the default grub menu option, since I very
rarely reboot).
<p>
That works very reliably both on my Viglen Genie desktop PC running
Fedora 16, with intel integrated graphics and my Dell Latitude E6410,
also with intel integrated graphics. Both machines use the i915 module
(required for intel graphics) which some people suspect is the cause of
the problems.
<p>
This solution required me to remember to edit the grub.cfg file after a
kernel update, making a copy of the new entry without the special flag,
to be used for booting and one with the special flag, for resuming from
hibernate. Doing the hibernates by hand was error-prone (and a mistake
could produce an unbootable machine requiring rescue by using a Live-CD,
to fix the edit). Also, the kernel update process (on Fedora) uses a
program called 'grubby' which copies the kernel settings from the
running kernel for the new kernel, which meant that by default I had
maxcpus=1 set for the new kernel. So if I forgot to edit the grub.cfg
file before rebooting after an update I booted in an unsatisfactory
mode.
<p>
My messy but working solution is to create two simple shell scripts
called
<ul>
<li>
'edit-grub'
(to create a copy of grub.cfg suitable for use when resuming)
and
<li>
'do-hibernate' (to save grub.cfg and replace it with the
edited version, just before calling pm-hibernate).
<br/>
Invoke this instead of 'pm-hibernate' to use the mechanism.
</ul>
Both are available here:
<a href="edit-grub">edit-grub</a> and
<a href="do-hibernate">do-hibernate</a>

## edit-grub
## Aaron Sloman http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs
## 31 May 2012
## This is used after a new kernel is installed. It makes a copy of
## grub.cfg called grub.cfg-resume which it edits so as to insert 'maxcpus=1'
## as a boot flag in the kernel line.
##
## It also alters the menu heading to show RESUME so that after
## hibernate when the machine is next booted there is a reminder that
## hibernate, not shut-down, was used.
##
## This program uses 'ed'. It would probably be better to use 'sed',
## but I am unfamiliar with it, and can't be bothered to learn just now.

## go to directory containing grub.cfg
cd /boot/grub2

## save the old version of grub.cfg-resume
mv grub.cfg-resume grub.cg-resume-bak

## make a copy of the latest grub.cfg, called grub.cfg-resume

## Aaron Sloman http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs
## 31 May 2012

## This is used to hibernate after saving grub.cfg and copying
## grub.cfg-resume to grub.cfg, so that when resuming after hibernate
## the flag 'maxcpus=1' will be used, inserted into grub.cfg-resume by
## the edit-grub script
##
## After successful resume, the saved version of grub.cfg is restored
##
## The use of killall plugin-container is not essential, but I noticed
## that with firefox running the size of plugin-container could grow very large
## and it seemed unnecessary to include that in the hibernate image, since it
## is automatically restarted on demand.

cd /boot/grub2

if  [ -f grub.cfg-resume ]; then

    echo "killall plugin-container"
    killall plugin-container

    ## Make sure windows partitions are unmounted

    ## If you sometimes mount windows partitions on the hard drive in
    ## linux it's a good idea to unmount them all before hibernating,
    ## in case you do something in windows inconsistent with the information
    ## saved in linux.
    ## This is an example -- edit or remove, as needed:

    ##echo "unmounting /win7c"
    umount /win7c

    echo "Ready to hibernate"
    echo "Saving grub.cfg"
    mv grub.cfg grub.cfg-saved
    echo "Set up grub.cfg-resume as grub.cfg"
    cp -p grub.cfg-resume grub.cfg
    sleep 2
    /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate
    echo "Restore grub.cfg-saved"
    mv grub.cfg-saved grub.cfg

else

    echo "Cannot find grub.cfg-resume"

    exit

fi
</pre>
</small>
</ul>
So all I have to do now is remember to run 'edit-grub' after a kernel
update, and before I first attempt to hibernate. Then instead of using
the 'pm-hibernate' command I invoke 'do-hibernate'.
<p>
A minor risk is that if the resume ever does not complete I shall have
the wrong version of grub.cfg and will have to restore grub.cfg-saved
manually. If I forget to do that the next boot will present me with the
'RESUME' option showing, and I can edit the grub command from the boot
menu to remove the maxcpus=1 portion. Then after booting I can restore
the grub.cfg-saved file. However, since resume now works very reliably I
don't expect to have that problem.
<p>
I have been using this solution now since early May 2012. I was
offered the option of editing scripts used by grub2 but that was
unacceptably obscure and messy.
<p>
Ideally the kernel code invoked by pm-hibernate should be changed so
that during the resume process, if it detects that the i915 module is
being used, it should turn off acpi before the last stage of resuming.
Then when the saved image is restored the state will have acpi on again
as it was when the last pm-hibernate command was given.
<P>
<b>REMINDER:</b> see the warning about re-starting/re-booting from
inside windows <a href="#restart">above</a>.
<p>
<b>NOTE added 15 Jun 2012 -- revised 14 Oct 2012:</b>
<br/>
I noticed that when I resume with the acpi=off or the maxcpus=1 switch
set in grub.cfg (which always resumes perfectly) it reports using only 1
thread for decompression (though it still goes very fast). If I resume
without that setting then it reports using 3 threads for decompression.
<p>
In both cases pm-hibernate uses 3 threads for compression.
<p>
So I wondered whether the crash+reboot on resume could be connected with
use of 3 threads for
decompression. With help from Bojan Smojver I managed to rule out
a decompression bug as cause of the resume failure. Details in this
bugreport (between comments 22 and 28):
