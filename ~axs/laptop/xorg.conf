#   Option  "XkbDisable"

# To customise the XKB settings to suit your keyboard, modify the
# lines below (which are the defaults).  For example, for a non-U.S.
# keyboard, you will probably want to use:
#   Option  "XkbModel"  "pc102"
# If you have a US Microsoft Natural keyboard, you can use:
#   Option  "XkbModel"  "microsoft"
#
# Then to change the language, change the Layout setting.
# For example, a german layout can be obtained with:
#   Option  "XkbLayout" "de"
# or:
#   Option  "XkbLayout" "de"
#   Option  "XkbVariant"    "nodeadkeys"
#
# If you'd like to switch the positions of your capslock and
# control keys, use:
    Option  "XkbOptions"    "ctrl:swapcaps"
# Or if you just want both to be control, use:
#   Option  "XkbOptions"    "ctrl:nocaps"
