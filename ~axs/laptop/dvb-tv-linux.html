<h3><b>
What I did:
</b></h3>

On a whim I bought a "Pinnacle DVB-T stick ultimate"
<p>
I managed, after some false starts, to get it working on my laptop
running fedora 10.
<p>
<b>Crucial steps:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Get the firmware
<pre>
    wget http://www.wi-bw.tfh-wildau.de/~pboettch/home/linux-dvb-firmware/dvb-usb-dib0700-1.10.fw
</pre>
<li>
copy into /lib/firmware
<li>
Plug in usb stick, and check that it is recognized, in
        /var/log/messages
<p>
This is what I got in
/var/log/messages, minus stuff at the beginning of each line:

<small>
<pre>
    usb 1-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
    usb 1-5: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
    dvb-usb: found a 'Pinnacle PCTV 72e' in cold state, will try to load a firmware
    firmware: requesting dvb-usb-dib0700-1.10.fw
    dvb-usb: downloading firmware from file 'dvb-usb-dib0700-1.10.fw'
    dib0700: firmware started successfully.
    dvb-usb: found a 'Pinnacle PCTV 72e' in warm state.
    dvb-usb: will pass the complete MPEG2 transport stream to the software demuxer.
    DVB: registering new adapter (Pinnacle PCTV 72e)
    DVB: registering frontend 0 (DiBcom 7000PC)...
    DiB0070: successfully identified

    dvb-usb: schedule remote query interval to 150 msecs.
    dvb-usb: Pinnacle PCTV 72e successfully initialized and connected.
    usb 1-5: New USB device found, idVendor=2304, idProduct=0236
    usb 1-5: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
    usb 1-5: Product: Pinnacle 72e
    usb 1-5: Manufacturer: LITEON
    usb 1-5: SerialNumber: 8UQ

<li>
Do scanning to get the channels avaiable:

<pre>
        w_scan -f t -A 1 -c GB -X > channels.conf
</pre>

It took a long time (about 8 minutes??) but
found 64 channels (TV and radio), using rooftop tv aerial
rather than the indoor aerial that came in the box.

<li>
Run vlc, using the channels list:
<pre>
        vlc channels.conf
</pre>
</ul>

I was amazed at how well it worked, on my Dell Latitude D610, running
Fedora 10.
<p>
I had actually installed mythtv, thinking I might need it, but that
turned out to be unnecessary.
<p>
I have not yet tried using the remote control that came with it.
I don't know whether there's any hope of it working without the
manufacturer's windows software.
<p>
Next I tried plugging in the little indoor aerial supplied with the
stick, in my study upstairs instead of the external aerial cable
available only downstairs.
<p>
I could get it to work upstairs, but only near a window with the aerial
suspended in a very specific location near the top of the window!
<p>
(w_scan worked there too.)
<p>
However not all the listed channels seemed to work.
<p>
I shall try with an amplified indoor aerial, later.
