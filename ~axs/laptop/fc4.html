<h2><b>
PROBLEM WITH SAVED IMAGES AND OTHER THINGS ON FC4 AND  FC5
<br>
CAUSED BY DEFAULT SECURITY SETTINGS
</b></h2>

<h3><b>
News: 11 Aug 2006
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Problems turned up in Fedora Core 4 due to the RedHat security
modifications (selinux ?) to Linux. The same problems were found in FC
5. So I present a summary here, and a solution.
<p>
<blockquote>
The summary, extracted from
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html">
the Free Poplog website</a> is
<ul>
<li>
For a temporary solution:
<br>
To turn off randomization in memory allocator 'malloc' temporarily give
this command as super-user:
<blockquote>
     sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
</blockquote>
To temporarily turn off
Exec-shield (a security modification to the Linux
kernel that makes large parts of specially-marked programs -- including
their stack -- not executable) give this command as super-user
<blockquote>
    sysctl -w kernel.exec-shield=0
</blockquote>
<li>
For a <b>permanent</b> solution turn both off as follows
<br>
As super-user edit your /etc/sysctl.conf file to contain these lines:
<blockquote>

    kernel.randomize_va_space=0
<br>
    kernel.exec-shield=0
</blockquote>
</ul>
</blockquote>

I have heard that the problems don't arise on 64bit FC5.

Background information and further details

A message, describing a problem and a partial solution, was
posted to the comp.lang.pop news group and pop-forum email list on 19
Mar 2006

I previously reported a mysterious problem with saved images on fedora
core 4 and also some
of the more recent FC 3 kernels with SWSUSP available
here:

The problem was that running saved images did not work: e.g. the 'pop11'
command, which is equivalent to
<p>
<pre>
    basepop11 +startup
</pre>
<p>
worked only randomly.
<p>
Later when I tried a machine running FC4, I thought the problem had been
solved, but when a colleague installed FC4 he reported the same problem
with saved images, though he could run basepop11 and compile the code
for the saved images, losing a little time whenever he started. Chris
Dollin also reported the problem.

Today I finally tried using the information there, but was not
able to fix the problem until I made a lucky guess that worked.
<p>
That file states:

</pre>
<p>
However when I tried that I got
<p>
<pre>
    kernel.exec-shield-randomize' is an unknown key
</pre>
<p>
After searching for other things, I had the idea of reading the
man file for sysctl, where I found that '-a' shows the available
values. So I did
<pre>
    sysctl -a | grep rand
</pre>
<p>
and got this as one of the outputs:
<pre>
    kernel.randomize_va_space = 1
</pre>
<p>
So I tried (nervously)
<pre>
    sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
</pre>
<p>
and after that the saved images started every time!
<p>
So I have inserted the following in /etc/sysctl.conf
<p>
<pre>
   # Prevent problems starting saved images
   kernel.randomize_va_space=0
</pre>
<p>
I also later found this online discussion of the issue:
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0504.3/1451.html">http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0504.3/1451.html</a>
</pre>
<p>
which is part of quite a long inconclusive thread about how to do
this on a per program basis instead of globally.
<p>
It seems that the randomize_va_space mechanism is designed to thwart
some viruses. My understanding is that other linux distributions do not
use it. It does not seem to be a good security mechanism for a general
linux installation if it can break random programs and there is no
easy way to turn it off for programs known to be 'safe'. (People
reported trying to use 'setarch' without success.)
<p>
Anyhow, this information should help users of recent Fedora Core or
Redhat systems who wish to use Poplog (and other systems defeated by the
security settings) and are willing to turn off a security measure that
is not included in other linux distributions.
