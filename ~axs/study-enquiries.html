Introduction: I cannot take any PhD students or Interns
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
NOTE: This document was first produced many years ago. Since then I have become
less involved in teaching and supervising. In particular, I cannot accept intern
students or PhD students, and do not have up to date information on current
arrangements for students.
<br>

<p>
Instead of writing to me about internships or courses at Birmingham University,
please search the School of computer Science web site:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/</a>
<p>
I get regular enquiries about internships and about the possibility of doing a PhD
with me. I don't answer letters from people who say they have read my home page and
really want to work with me and then reveal by what they write that they have NOT
read my web page and know nothing about my work.

<b>Current research (Added: 14 Feb 2016)</b>
<blockquote>

Since around 2011 I have been working mainly on several topics related to the
Turing-inspired Meta-Morphogenesis project, summarised here (and in many more
pages linked to these):

I can't offer supervision on any of this work, but I'll be interested to hear
from anyone working on these topics.

<h3><b>
PhD enquiries
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
I am not formally available for PhD supervision, as I have passed
the UK retirement age, though I am still doing research full time,
and in some cases I help PhD students who are supervised by other
people in this department.
<p>
I no longer deal with PhD applications and I have no funds available
at my personal disposal for PhD students.
<p>
As regards students who already have funding who wish to work with
me while formally supervised by someone else, I can only consider
those who identify a gap in my research activity which they think
they can fill. I would require substantial experience of programming
in an AI language (Lisp, or pop11 or prolog).
<p>
Letters which say 'I am very interested in your research' but do not
give any evidence of knowledge of my research are not taken seriously.
<p>
I don't have time to read CVs sent to me, but I can provide the
following information.
<p>
If you wish to apply to study for a PhD here, please read the following
web pages and follow instructions (I don't check these links
regularly, so you may have to be creative if some are out of date!):
<p>
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/</a>
<br>
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/</a>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/apply.php">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/apply.php</a>
<p>
Those web pages give detailed information, including pointers to online
application forms, and information about funding,
i.e.
<br>
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/scholarships.php">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/scholarships.php</a>
<p>
Detailed questions about funding etc. can be sent to the PhD Admissions
tutor,
<p>
    research-admissions[AT]cs.bham.ac.uk
<p>
If you submit a formal application and it looks good (i.e. you have an
outstanding academic record, and your academic referees write strong
recommendations concerning your research potential), and if someone is
available to supervise you within the topic area you have specified or a
related topic area, then the School will let you know.
<p>
<b>NB</b>
<blockquote>
If you wish to study here for a PhD, you should try to submit, with
your application, a proposal (at most a page or two) that you think
will show your ability to identify a problem and indicate your
ability think about how to start working on it. If possible you
should try to match it to interests of one or more members of staff
in the school, but that is not as important as showing your research
qualities.
<p>
Even if someone wishes to supervise your work that still leaves
the problem of obtaining funding, and you should try if possible to
obtain financial support from your own country for study here.
<p>
If nobody wants to supervise work on the specific area you have
described someone else may suggest an area that could interest you.
<p>
Your description of the kind of research you wish to do will
help the reviewers decide whether you are ready to do research.

Summer Internships

I have no funds for internships and since I no longer do undergraduate teaching there
