How to stop sending your email in duplicate!
</b></h2>
<H3>For users of email on Windows, Mac, Gmail, and other WYSIWYG mail programs</H3>
<small>
<hr/>
<b>NOTE ON FORMATTING:</b>
<br>
Adjust the width of your browser window to make the lines the length you
prefer.
<br>
This web site does not attempt to impose restrictions on line length or
font size.
<hr />
</small>
<P>
Do you belong to the class of people who, without realising it,
send your messages in duplicate:
once in nice compact plain text, accompanied by a copy in bulky
html, wasting bandwidth, file space, and time of people who
archive messages and want to save space.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are energy and materials costs associated with
transmitting, processing at relays, checking for malware, storing,
archiving, and providing extra bandwidth to cope with unnecessary
bulk. (See
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/html-email-costs.html">this discussion note.</a>)
</P>
<P>
If you have never heard of this issue then it is very likely that you
are unknowingly using software on which duplication of email you send
is turned on by default -- a dreadful and wasteful design feature (like
many others found in widely used software).
</P>
<P>
You may also be one of those annoying people who send space-wasting
image files attached to every email message.
<br/>
PLEASE do not send them to me.
</P>

<P>
And even if you don't send your messages in duplicate, you may still
be sending large html files when a small plain text file will convey
exactly what you want to say, just as well.
<br/>
PLEASE do not send them to me.
</P>
<P>
The following web sites explain why you should turn the
duplication off and avoid sending html when plain text will suffice
(except when sending mail to those people who <I>want</I> to get
html messages), and how to do it:

<hr/>
It is worth noting that the practice of sending email in html is one of
the sources of serious fraud. That's because most email readers don't
show you the html source but simply interpret it. As a result innocent
and not very well informed people may think they are clicking on a link
to their bank or to a reputable company when in fact they are connecting
to something much more dangerous that will attempt to extract private
information (and ultimately money) from them. If all messages were in
plain text and viewed in that form this particular trick would not
work.
<hr/>
<p>
<b>Exceptions</b>
<blockquote>
There are cases when you need to send information that includes
figures, tables, graphs, etc. that are not easy to format in
plain text (especially as different mail readers may
format plain text differently, e.g. handling tabs differently and
breaking lines in different places.)
<p>
In such cases it is appropriate to add an attachment to your plain
text message containing a file of a different sort, e.g. PDF, HTML,
JPEG. (Beware of RTF however: it was originally a
platform-independent format, but RTF files produced by Microsoft
software often do not display properly on other systems.)
<p>
In some cases it may be appropriate for the whole message to be
a formatted, printable file, using html, or some mixture.
<p>
So although there are cases where including something other than
plain text can be justified, if you <i>always</i> send messages in
BOTH plain text and html, even when they contain nothing but plain
text, then that is wasteful and specially inconsiderate to people
who do not wish to receive everything in duplicate.
</blockquote>


<hr/>
I reserve the right to ignore messages that waste bandwidth, file space,
and my time by arriving in both plain text and HTML formats. Please use
only plain text for queries, comments, suggestions, requests, and
friendly messages.
<p>
If you have to send something including diagrams, images, tables,
graphs, etc. then send PDF.
<p>
But I prefer not to be sent attachments that I have not asked for:
if possible, please put your paper on the web, and send me a link.
Or if you can't do that send me a plain text summary and
ask me if I want to receive your pdf paper. Don't just <i>send</i>
it.
<p>
<b>Using Word Files</b>
<br>
Please do not assume that everyone in the universe
can read Word (doc) files or wishes to read them rather than documents
that conform to published standards, such as ODF or PDF.
<p>
Government funded organisations (including Universities of course)
should <i>insist</i> that all their documents do conform to freely
available, published standards, instead of being readable only by using
proprietary software.
