This is a list of (mostly) invited talks/presentations/discussions
between 2001 and 2009, originally prepared in order to support our
departmental submission on research performance. I stopped updating
this document when it seemed no longer to be relevant. The up to
date list of presentations is available in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/talks/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/talks/</a>
<hr>
Most of the item listed below are research presentations in academe
or industry.
<br/>
A few are public presentations of a different kind, e.g.
<a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/">Cafe Scientifique</a>
presentations.
<p>
For each presentation a link is given to more detailed information
about its contents, and a downloadable (PDF) version of the
presentation. The more detailed information is collected in two
places

How to Think About Cognitive Systems: Requirements and Designs
<br>
<blockquote>
<small>
White paper and slides prepared for
DARPA Workshop on Cognitive Systems,
<br>
Airlie House, Warrenton, Virginia, USA, 3-6 Nov 2002.
<br>
For some reason the papers, presentations, and organisational
information about that workshop are no longer available on the web.
<br>
I have copies of most of them.
<p>
I was the only person invited from outside the USA to the workshop.
<br>
My recommendation, not to focus on how to design an intelligent
office assistant with the capabilities of a highly competent adult
(e.g. Radar O'Reilly in MASH), but instead to focus research
resources on trying to replicate as much as possible of the
intelligence of a young child (not a new-born infant) including,
above all trying to understand the <i>requirements</i>, for such a
system, before rushing into designs, was not accepted.

<a href="http://www.ik2007.de/html/ik2002.html">http://www.ik2007.de/html/ik2002.html</a>
<br>
Four lectures presented:

<ul>
<li>
1: Virtual machine architectures and their relations so
physical machines. Minds and their relations to brains. Muddled
ideas about emotions (and freedom).
<li>
2: Reactive, deliberative and meta-management layers in
the human architecture, and how they might have evolved.
<li>
3: How the layers relate to different sorts of
architectures. The COGAFF architecture-schema and the H-Cogaff
proposed schematic architecture.
<li>
4: What are your objections? How does this relate to
alternative theories? Have we accounted for everything (including
qualia?). Unsolved problems: where next?
