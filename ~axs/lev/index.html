<h2>
EVOLVABLE VIRTUAL INFORMATION PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES
<br/>
FOR HUMAN-LIKE MINDS
</h2>
<P>
In 1999
<a href="http://www.leverhulme.org.uk">the Leverhulme Trust</a>
awarded funds to
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/">Aaron Sloman</a>, for a three
year project, to investigate
<b>Evolvable virtual information processing architectures
for human-like minds</b>.
<P>

<h3><b>
Research Fellows funded by the project
</b></h3>
The grant was originally awarded with funds for one Research Fellow
for three years. For various reasons the RF post was held by three
people in succession, with gaps that cause the project to last
somewhat longer than three years, with beneficial results!
<ol>
<li>
The project was initially set up with Dr. Brian Logan, who had
worked with Aaron Sloman on a DERA-funded since 1995.
In November 1999, shortly after this project started,
he moved to a lectureship at Nottingham
University, though his collaboration on this project continued after
his move. See
<a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~bsl/">http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~bsl/</a>
<P>
<li>
It took several months to find a suitable replacement. Eventually,
in June 2000
Dr. Matthias Scheutz, on leave from the University of Notre Dame
joined the project. For various reasons he could not stay more than
13 months.
<P>
Matthias returned to his post at Notre Dame University in August
2001 though we also continue collaboration. He is now at Indiana
University.

<P>
<li>
The third occupant of the post, enlarging the collaboration still
further, was
<a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/ronc/">Ron Chrisley</a>
then a
senior lecturer at The University of Sussex, which granted him
leave to work here for 21 months from October 2001.
