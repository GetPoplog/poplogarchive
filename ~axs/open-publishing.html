Make everything freely available on the web

<b>NOTE:</b> I now have a more comprehensive web page on this topic
here: <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/open-access-journals.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/open-access-journals.html</a>

<p>

I believe the future of academic publishing in most fields lies in free,
open access (in accordance with ideals of the 'Creative Commons'
initiative) with retrospective accreditation based on ongoing critical
comment and evaluation --- which will often be more objective and
considered than the hasty evaluations produced by referees for journals,
conferences and workshops. Results of research funded by tax-payers
should be freely available to anyone, not just specialists in the field
-- including people in poorer countries whom we exploit by employing
their expensively trained professionals.
<P>
Accordingly, all my papers,
presentations, and discussion notes are freely available online.
<p>
I also maintain an extensive web site of free, open source, software
developed here and elsewhere, based on the Poplog system (originally
developed at Sussex University and marketed by ISL until 1998).
