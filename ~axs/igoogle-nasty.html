Yesterday, Sunday 27th July, I noticed that I could not invoke a
google search as I am accustomed to, by typing something in the
search panel at the top right of Firefox and then pressing the
'Return' key.

<p>
Instead I had to go to www.google.com.

<p>
But I did not get the usual mostly empty page with a box in which to
type my search query: instead I got a multi-panel web page with all
sorts of junk in it -- London tube map, weather reports, news
headlines, advertisements, lists of links of various sorts, and
worst of all a panel inviting me to visit a horoscope site.

<p>
It announced itself as 'iGoogle', something I had never heard of,
and a panel came up saying I had been chosen to try out iGoogle and
inviting me to fill in a questionaire.

<hr />
<p>
<h3><b>
Here are some of my answers.
</b></h3>

<b>How did you come to iGoogle</b>
<blockquote>
I did not come to it.
<p>
It came to me while I was trying to use google search and I was
EXTREMELY annoyed
<p>
(a) because the google search panel on firefox stopped working so that I
had to explicitly invoke google and then type in my search command,
while lots of unwanted junk appeared on my screen
<p>
(b) because I have no interest in turning google into some sort of
general purpose interface to the universe.
<p>
I use google search a lot and google news occasionally. I  don't want
news or anything else to be shoved in my face when I simply want to
answer a search question.
<p>
The rest of the page was sheer junk. Why should I want a London tube map
when I live in Birmingham? Why should I care about how yoga people do
headstands. Why give me a sports panel when I am not interested in
sports.
<p>
Above all it is utterly APPALLING that google panders to the
superstitious idiocy of the uneducated masses by presenting a panel
about horoscopes. Either you are very patronising or else you have very
low intellectual standards and take that stuff seriously yourself.
<p>
Now I have to find out how to turn off this junk. Maybe I should just
use another search engine.
<p>
Ugh!
</blockquote>

<b>The question: Typically, how often do you visit iGoogle?</b>
<blockquote>
Should have an answer option: I NEVER WANT TO VISIT IT.
<p>
Likewise the question: When did you first use iGoogle?
<p>
should have an option: i did not visit it: it was inflicted on me.
</blockquote>


<b>Two more questions</b>
<blockquote>
<b>
What if anything do you find frustrating or unappealing about iGoogle?
<br>
What changes or additional features would you like to see for iGoogle?</b>
</blockquote>


My answers:

<blockquote>
I don't want to see it at all.
<p>
I have no interest in something that chooses a collection of web
resources for me and shoves them in my face when I want to do something
else.
<p>
I can use my own bookmarks and shortcuts to get directly to sites that
interest me.
<p>
I also usually keep multiple tabs and windows live in firefox as an
extension to my short term memory (especially since I can restore them
after a crash or reboot).
<br/>
Normally I don't reboot because I use SWSUSP2
on Linux instead.
</blockquote>

<b>One of the very worst features was that there was nothing on the
page telling me how to restore the previous state.
</b>
<p>
I eventually managed to restore normal google function as a result
of sequence of semi-random experiments.
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don't
recall exactly what I did, so I cannot help other users.
