<b>Weizac - An Interim Adventure Between Ada and Responsa</b>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
 Weizac, was designed and built in 1954/55 at the Weizmann
 Institute of Science. We will attempt to convey the special
 pioneering spirit prevailing while constructing the first digital
 computer in the Middle East, its main characteristics and its
 profound impact in catapulting the then 6-year old state of Israel
 into the high-tech era that early. Time permitting, we will briefly
 describe the Responsa Project, the first viable full-text retrieval
 system, conceived 35 years before Google, whose first steps were
 done on Weizac.

<b>Myths and Method:
<br>
Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and the First Computer Program</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Any celebration of Ada Lovelace is
founded on a single publication, her Notes, published in 1843,
on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Lovelace includes as
an example a description of how the Analytical Engine could
calculate Bernoulli numbers and for this she has become known
as "the first programmer". I propose to examine the basis of this
claim. For this I will review the trajectory of Babbage's
calculating Engines - his motives for designing them, his
aspirations for their use, and their design - interleaving into this
Lovelace's own work. Finally, I examine the substance
of Lovelace's contribution to computing. I suggest that Lovelace
deserves to be celebrated as fully as she is, but not necessarily
for the reasons most frequently given.

<b>Zero Knowledge Proofs and Applications</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
We shall present the surprising concept of Zero Knowledge
Proofs. A Prover knows a solution to a problem. He proves the
existence of a solution and his knowledge of it to a Verifier. This
is done in a Zero Knowledge fashion. Namely, the Verifier is
convinced of the truth of the above two statements but learns
nothing about the solution or anything else. We shall explain in
an easily understood way. We shall also present a simple novel
method for ZKPs and give important practical applications. The
lecture is self-contained and widely accessible.

<b>From Aristotle to the iPhone</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Logic started as a branch of philosophy, going back to Greeks,
who loved debates, in the classical period. Computers are
relatively young, dating back to World War II, in the middle of
the 20th century. This talk tells the story of how logic begat
computing, tracing the surprising path from Aristotle to the
iPhone. This is a story full of both intellectual drama, as well as
real-life drama, with most of the characters dying young,
miserable, or both.

<b>When Does a Slime Mould Compute?</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Some people are using billiard balls, chemicals, bacteria, slime
moulds, soap films, spaghetti, even black holes, as computers
(although some of these only in theory yet). But what does it
mean for such unconventional substrates to compute? I will
introduce our framework for physical computing, give
requirements for physical system to be used as a computer, and
show how some unconventional substrates are indeed computing,
and how others are not.

<b>Evolved Construction-kits for Building Minds, Part I</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
This will be a highly interactive tutorial introduction to the Turing-inspired
Meta-Morphogenesis Project, which brings together a host
of problems and ideas about evolution, how it started on a lifeless
planet, how natural selection produced branching layers of
construction kits (some physical, some abstract, and some hybrid),
and how these made possible increasingly complex and varied
morphologies and behaviours based on increasingly complex and
varied forms of information processing. Among many topics to be
discussed are the unknown evolutionary precursors to human
abilities to make mathematical discoveries leading up to Euclid's
<i>Elements</i>, and related aspects of human and animal visual abilities.
Support for Kant's philosophy of mathematics will be presented,
along with criticisms of the visual, mathematical, and linguistic
competences of current AI systems. Some possible ways of
overcoming those limitations will be considered, with implications
for current theories of how brains function.
An extended abstract will be made available here:

<b>Proving the Church-Turing Thesis</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Ada Lovelace wrote presciently about the possibilities and limitations of
digital numerical calculations. She recognized that Babbage's Analytical Engine
was sui generis and wrote that "the engine [is] the material expression of any
indefinite function of any degree of generality and complexity." This we now
know was overstating her case. I will discuss the recent formalization of the
notion of effective computation and some of its consequences vis-a-vis
computability and complexity of computation.

<b>Structure in the Theory of Computing:
<br>
Algorithms, Randomness, Cryptography and Hardness</b>
<br>
The world around us, namely nature, society, science,
mathematics,... presents us with a huge number and
variety of computational problems, and for each we seek
solutions which minimize various resources while
maintaining other desirable properties. The Theory of
Computation is charged with figuring out the feasibility
and costs of this multitude of problems. Surprisingly, the
past few decades of work have revealed remarkable
structure: this complex world of problems, resources and
properties clusters into few natural clusters which
furthermore have conceptual meanings. I will try to
survey some important aspects of this body of work,
including: the tools of reduction and completeness, the
reasons for clustering (which go to the very definition of
computation by Turing), and the major challenges for
better understanding of this universe.

<b>How to Build an Insecure System out of Perfectly Good Cryptography</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Academics tend to focus on subtle properties of the mathematical
tools in cryptography. Industry standards bodies tend to fight over
the syntax of messages. Although both of these are important,
this talk focuses on broader system design issues that tend to get
neglected. Examples will show deployed systems and standards
that use perfectly good cryptography, but are insecure in practice,
as well as lessons to be learned from these examples.

<b>Computing with Numbers and Other Non-Syntactic Things</b>
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Michael Rescorla has argued that it makes sense to compute
directly with numbers, and he faulted Turing for not giving an
analysis of this. In line with a later paper of his, I'll argue that it
only makes sense to compute directly with syntactic entities, such

issues of notation, and broader issues involving de re
propositional attitudes towards numbers and other non-syntactic
abstract entities.
