<h3><b>
Why is there so little discussion of the damage done by religion?
</b></h3>
There has been much discussion
recently of a book claiming that pressures
to conform to requirements for 'political correctness' (PC) have
distorted public discussion and debate on important issues, and led to
bad decisions.
<p>
I've been too busy to listen continuously, but one taboo that has not
been mentioned in discussion of PC that I've heard is criticism of
religion.
<p>
All the recent concern about not offending people who have religious
beliefs of one sort or another is a dreadful tendency. E.g. there are
very strong arguments against allowing faith-based schools to receive
any public support, because they corrupt young minds by forcing them
down narrow channels, stultifying the development of critical,
analytical facilities --- yet people dare not present those arguments.
<blockquote>
<small>
Some time after writing that,
I was proved wrong by the television broadcasts
(in the UK)
in which Richard Dawkins was allowed to present the arguments, as
<a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=48252">reported
here, for example</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately, while I share many of his scientific views, I don't think
he finds the most effective ways of communicating with his opponents
-- not that it is easy to communicate with closed-minded bigots whose
analytical thinking processes were damaged in childhood. The ones who
are in it for financial gain and power are a different matter and
have too much to lose so arguing with them is probably a waste of time.
<p>
But the effort should be made, just in case. I've known cases where it
took a long time, but worked. However, it requires great skill in giving
philosophical tutorials, for which most scientists are not well trained.

</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
We should not be prevented from speaking the truth in the (long term)
public interest just because it may offend someone. We must criticise
those who bind the minds of their children just as we must criticise
groups who bind the feet of their children as described
<a href="http://www.towson.edu/~loiselle/foot.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/chin/foot.html"> here
</a>

<blockquote>
<small>
Many people regard foot-binding as cruel and morally reprehensible
and something to be criticised strongly, even if that is what
some parents want for their children.
<p>
Mind-binding to stop the mind growing naturally by interacting with many
physical things and many ideas from many sources
(as illustrated in the theory about child learning outlined here
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/orthogonal-competences.html">here</a>)
is just as cruel and morally reprehensible as foot-binding.
<p>
If the parents feel offended when we criticise them, that is no reason
to let the malpractice continue. People who are offended by comment or
criticism have no right to silence the criticism. They have every right
to produce counter-arguments and evidence to point out mistakes. If
their only evidence is argument from authority, they cannot expect
free spirits to be convinced. But they have the right to try.
<p>
Governments who try to criminalise the giving of offence because they
wish to win votes from religious bigots with bound minds, should also be
strongly resisted.
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the UK it is acceptable to say that casting chicken entrails to
discover the future is superstition, or that the practice of treating
children as witches in the Congo is cruel and superstitious (see
<a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2660757.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2660757.stm</a>).
<p>
But it seems to have become
politically incorrect to point out that allowing sex
only between people who have been through a religious ritual
is superstitious prejudice, or that praying to your god to make the
future go your way is foolish superstition, often matched by the
superstition of others who are praying for the opposite result at the
same time -- sometimes even praying to the same god.
<p>
I did not hear any public comment on the wimbledon tennis winner
(Ivansevic) who thought his god had caused him to win (though he was
happy enough to accept the trophy as if he had won it!).
<p>
It's OK to say that what Hitler wrote about ethics is wicked, but not
that the recent Pope was wicked when he compared abortion to the
holocaust (as reported by the BBC:
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4288103.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4288103.stm</a>
), since policies based on
such views do dreadful harm to many women (and their families) in
catholic countries.
<p>
How
much cruelty is caused by the superstitious religious objection to birth
control in many parts of the world?
That sort of harm done by Pope Paul
was never mentioned when there were all the hushed reverent broadcasts
about him before and shortly after his death.
<p>
A lot of muddled thinking goes unchallenged in BBC religious broadcasts,
e.g. claims that everyone needs some form of religion, that it is
impossible to have moral standards without religion, and other
completely unsubstantiated generalisations uttered by unctuous
religious representatives.
<p>
<h3><b>
Morals without religion
</b></h3>
Margaret Knight gave a talk on "Morals without religion" some time in
the 1950s pointing out the ignorance and stupidity
of such views in the BBC woman's
hour radio programme, and created a storm of protest. She then wrote an
excellent little book about the episode "Morals without religion" 1955.

<p>
That book should be regularly referenced in all schools, but I fear it
would not now be politically correct to <i>require</i> faith schools to
introduce their students to criticisms of religion, including moral as
well as scientific criticism.
<p>
As a result, far too many impressionable young minds have their
intellectual development stunted: their minds are bound and prevented
from growing, to meet the wishes of priests and parents, and in some
cases, less obviously, political rulers. Many of the people who are most
strongly offended by criticisms of their religion do not know that that
strong feeling of offence and the vindictive rage that they feel as a
result, is part of a mechanism by which they are being used as pawns of
priests and others who have enslaved their minds in order to maintain
power and control.
<p>
So, strictly, we should not be criticising <i>the parents who bind the
minds of their children,</i> but rather <i>the thoughts, morals,
principles and religious views</i> by which their own minds have been
bound and prevented from developing properly. The people who are so
enslaved do not know what they are doing for they have never tasted
another life.
<p>
(Unlike them I was never exposed to an educational system that forced me
to adopt my opinions: I have never been forbidden to read any books, to
look at any pictures, to consider any arguments or evidence.)

<p>
I fear that the result may be a growing drift towards religious
fundamentalism in the UK, as a result of which important political
decisions will be be influenced by superstition and vicious moral
absolutism.
<p>
We've already seen it happen elsewhere, and we even have a prime
minister who thinks it's OK to cause bombs to be dropped on both guilty
and innocent people when he 'passionately believes' something is right.

<blockquote>
<small>
    (Try giving "passionately believe" + "blair" to google, to
    see how often he uses <i>his</i> passionate belief as a
    justification
    for his decisions. That's not the decision-making of a rational
    leader. Perhaps religious education stunted his intellectual
    development?)

In
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4689363.stm">a speech delivered in July 2005</a>
reported on the BBC new site, Blair stated

<blockquote>
The 20th century showed how powerful political ideologies could be. This
is a religious ideology, a strain within the world-wide religion of
Islam, as far removed from its essential decency and truth as Protestant
gunmen who kill Catholics or vice versa, are from Christianity. But do
not let us underestimate it or dismiss it.
<p>
Those who kill in its name believe genuinely that in doing it, they do
God's work; they go to paradise.
</blockquote>

Now he has been on
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm">a television chat show</a>
not quite saying that his killings in Iraq could be defended as
a way of doing God's work, but coming very close to it. He did not
confess to wanting to go to paradise.

</small>
</blockquote>
Incidentally, unlike some atheist scientists I am not afraid of having
opposing views taught and analysed in schools. I've argued here
<pre>
   <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/teaching-intelligent-design.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/teaching-intelligent-design.html</a>
</pre>
that 'Intelligent Design' should be taught alongside the theory of
evolution in order to help educate youngsters about the differences
between science and superstition, and also to explain how bad theories
need to be refuted -- just as students should learn about the ptolemaic
theory of planetary motion, Priestly's phlogiston theory, and Newton's
mechanics, now outdated by Einstein.
<p>
If well informed, philosophically educated science teachers were
available in schools it would be a wonderful opportunity to confront the
superstition of religious beliefs with ways of thinking characteristic
of the open-minded, empirical and analytical, search for truth. I fear
there are not enough of them.
