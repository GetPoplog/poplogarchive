<b>NOTE:</b>
<br>
The discussion below could be extended by pointing out that there is
a fifth notion of freedom which refers to what you are free to do
within a context of a game, a system of laws, a moral regime etc.
This notion of freedom is close to the notion of permission.
It is worth noting that the law may forbid something without
enforcing that proscription. So many people constantly do what they
are not free to do in this sense.

<h3><b>
Four Concepts of Free-will (two good, two garbage)
</b></h3>
<p>

There are at least four different notions of freedom that drive
philosophical and scientific discussions of free will. Two of them
make sense and are not only consistent with determinism, but depend on
the world being (largely) deterministic.

<p>
The other two notions of free will, one theological and one romantic,
are incoherent, but worries about them cause people to argue that
free will is inconsistent with determinism. People with such worries,
may need therapy more than they need arguments, since arguments
typically don't remove their worry, and, in my experience,
they are not able to produce
counter-arguments, only counter-assertions.

<p>
The four concepts are only briefly explained here.

<blockquote>
<b>
1. Ordinary language -- I came of my own free will, nobody forced me.
</b>

<blockquote>
   This is a widely used concept (or collection of concepts),
   at least in our culture. Its use is
   totally compatible with normal deterministic brain function.
   But there may be borderline/difficult cases (e.g. hypnotism,
    indoctrination).
    <p>
    In <a href="http://www.ditext.com/austin/plea.html">'A plea for
    excuses'</a>), J.L. Austin (in 1956) brilliantly and amusingly
    discussed some of the ways in which this concept is commonly
    used in making excuses, e.g. by
    explaining why something was or was not done, and resisting
    accusations either of acting under duress or coercion, or
    of not acting under duress or coercion.
<blockquote>
<hr>
<i>
"In this sort of way, the philosophical study of conduct can get off to a
positive fresh start. But by the way, and more negatively, a number of
traditional cruces or mistakes in this field can be resolved or removed.
First among these comes the problem of Freedom. While it has been the
tradition to present this as the 'positive' term requiring elucidation,
there is little doubt that to say we acted 'freely' (in the
philosopher's use, which is only faintly related to the everyday use) is
to say only that we acted not un-freely, in one or another of the many
heterogeneous ways of so acting (under duress, or what not). Like
'real', 'free' is only used to rule out the suggestion of some or all of
its recognized antitheses. As 'truth' is not a name for a characteristic
of assertions, so 'freedom' is not a name for a characteristic of
actions, but the name of a dimension in which actions are assessed. In
examining all the ways in which each action may not be 'free', i.e. the
cases in which it will not do to say simply 'X did A', we may hope to
dispose of the problem of Freedom."
</i>
<br>
(Austin, A Plea for Excuses)
<p>
Related points were made by around the same time by
Isaiah Berlin in
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/#1">
Two concepts of freedom</a>: he distinguished positive freedom, i.e.
'freedom to' from negative freedom, 'freedom from'.
<p>
Neither Austin nor Berlin

adopted or even knew about the design standpoint that
AI-informed philosophers adopt.
<hr>
</blockquote>
This "ordinary language" concept of freedom (or freewill) is the main notion
    that supports compatibilist theories of freewill: which claim that
    the existence of freewill is compatible with universal determinism.
    <p>
    An introduction to compatibilist theories of freewill can be found
    at
    <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">this
    philosophical web site</a>.
    However that document claims that assuming that freewill is
    'uniquely human' is a theory neutral assumption! I leave it to
    pet owners and robot designers to point out the silliness of that
    claim.
<br>
<b>NOTE: 8 Dec 2010:</b> I am pleased to report that that
wording seems to have been revised, since I wrote the above.
</blockquote>

<b>
2. Legal concept (close to 1):
   concerned with whether people can be held responsible for their
   actions in court.
</b>

<blockquote>

   This legal concept grows out of the ordinary language concept, though
   courts generally attempt (with varying success) to be more precise in
   the concepts and forms of arguments that can be used in settling
questions whose answers may determine whether someone does or does not
get fined, imprisoned, or in barbaric cultures mutilated or put to
death.
  <p>
    An example of legal attempts at clarification, including for example
    the relative importance of impaired ability to distinguish
    acceptable from unacceptable behaviour and impaired ability to
    resist impulses, can be found
    <a href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/bclc/crimweb/web1/appbrawner.htm">at this web site on penal law</a>
  <p>
   The legal arguments are also totally compatible with normal
    deterministic brain function, and in fact depend (implicitly) on
    assumptions concerning normal and abnormal functioning of the brains
    of plaintiffs, as indicated by reference to 'disease' or 'mental
    defect'.
  <p>
   But as with the ordinary concept of doing something of your own free
    will, there may be borderline/difficult cases for the legal
    notion (e.g. hypnotism,
    duress, mental illnesses, etc.) where experts invoked by legal
    teams will not necessarily agree. The existence of indeterminate
    borderline cases is a feature of many useful concepts of everyday
    life, though attempts to import them into scientific theories often
    generate muddle and confusion.

</blockquote>

<b>
3. Theological concept designed to let God off the hook:
</b>

<blockquote>

   The third notion of freewill is used in the theological claim that
   the alleged all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good god who created
   everything cannot be blamed for all the evil stuff that occurs in
    that creating (and there is a lot of it!) because it
   arises from our free will which he also gave us.
<p>
   This notion of freewill is an incoherent concept because nothing
    could possibly satisfy all its mutually contradictory requirements.
    It implies that we are to be blamed for the effects of our actions,
    because the world is sufficiently deterministic for the actions to
    have definite consequences, yet god cannot be so blamed. If god's
    creatures are not deterministic then that implies that god cannot
    know the consequences of what he is doing, which contradicts the
    claim that he is all-knowing. If he does know the consequences and
    they are evil and he takes no action to prevent the consequences
    (which he could do because he is all powerful) then he too is evil.
    (Read Hume for more detailed arguments: it's old stuff.)
<p>
    It is also worth commenting that a god who does not interfere when
    his 'offspring' turn bad cannot be described as anything like a
    loving parent, who will typically do as much as possible to help
    an errant child mend his or her ways, without being accused of
    tampering with the child's free will. (But the story in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a>
    draws attention to the possibility of some moral disagreement
    regarding what means are acceptable for improving decision making.
    It's just a myth that every question that can be asked must have right
    and wrong answers. Sometimes we just have to make up our minds
    what to do.)

</blockquote>

<b>
4. Romantic concept: used by many amateur and many professional
philosophers
</b>

<blockquote>
   People don't like the idea of being determined and predictable in
   principle, no matter how difficult it is to predict their
   decisions in practice. So they wish they were not like that, yet
   would like to feel in control of and responsible for their decisions
<p>
   Another incoherent concept -- because nothing could possibly satisfy all its
mutually contradictory requirements.
<br>
(This is related to the discussion below of whether there are any true
counterfactual conditionals in a deterministic universe.)

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The whole idea of freewill driving the philosophical
quest for an alternative to determinism is incoherent because nothing
could satisfy it -- not even Quantum Mechanics: randomness has nothing
to do with being free, as
Hume and many others have pointed out.
The main points were made long, long, ago by David Hume, and some of
them before him by John Locke, and probably others before them.
(I am no good at history.)
<p>
<hr>
There are various key ideas that have to be grasped.
<blockquote>
One is that within a complex portion of the universe, e.g. your left
thumb, or your brain,
or the whole of you, or a nation, or an ecosystem,
there will be very many processes that can be
described at different levels of abstraction: physical, chemical,
physiological, and in some cases in terms of thoughts, percepts,
desires, preferences, values, memories, capabilities, skills, and many
kinds of information. In some cases there are also social and political
processes.
A mechanical clock has fewer levels of
abstraction.
<p>
At any level of abstraction we can talk about how things
might have been different from what they actually are. E.g. the clock
now registers 13 minutes past 10, but it could have registered 23
minutes past 11 as far as the workings of the clock are concerned. They
allow for that possibility, which is why we can regard some
counterfactual conditionals as true and others false.
(This point is analysed further
<a href="#counterfactuals">below.</a>)
<p>
In the case of a typical mechanical watch or clock, things are very
rigidly determined, and it always goes through a fixed sequence of
states. But other mechanisms allow more flexibility. E.g. many digital
clocks and watches have buttons that allow the clock to be moved into a
mode in which it can jump between states in a different order, e.g.
increasing hours or minutes, or changing the day of week, month or year.
<p>
In particular, a digital watch allows the hour to be changed without changing
the minutes, but old mechanical watches do not allow this, unless you dismantle
the watch and either disengage the gears, or remove the hour hand and replace it
in a new position (which may or may not be possible -- depending on how the
spindle is shaped).
<p>
When the time on a digital watch is changed, the buttons in the watch
have to be pressed by someone <i>outside</i> the watch! But suppose you
built a system that had all sorts of internal controls that alter
internal and external behaviour, where those controls can themselves be
operated by other internal mechanisms. E.g. most digital watches cannot
adjust their own time, but the recently available radio watches can
detect that they are fast or slow and take remedial action. Maybe some
of them can also check whether the time signal is coming from an
authenticated source, and if not ignore it. We can say of such a watch
that it could have changed the time it is displaying, and it would have
done so if there had been a discrepancy with the radio timing signal.
<p>
If there is such a control architecture, then, for many states of the
system (at any level of abstraction) we may be able to say 'It could
have been otherwise', and we may able to say that unlike ordinary
digital watches, but like more sophisticated digital watches, it has
internal components that could have made the state different from what
it is now.
<p>
In the case of humans, some animals, and future robots, some of those
components (or states of components) play the role of desires, values,
preferences, goals, attitudes, likes, dislikes, ambitions, fears, etc.
and others contain beliefs about how the world is, about what can and
cannot be done, about what the prerequisites and consequences of various
changes are, about how various processes can be produced.
<blockquote>
Analysing what desires, values, etc. are in terms of their functional
role in a working system is a non-trivial task. A beginning is made in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/03.html#200305">
The Architectural Basis of Affective States and Processes (2005)
by Sloman, Chrisley and Scheutz.</a>
</blockquote>
<br>
This sort of analysis adopts <i>the design stance</i>, which is also
needed in order to understand products of evolution even though
evolution is not a designer with explicit goals that its designs
achieve. Instead it is a mechanism that manages to produce systems
that actually achieve those goals even though nobody designed them
to achieve those goals, and even though those goals were never
explicitly formulated, by evolutionary mechanisms or anything else:
they merely happen to be implicit in the processes of natural
selection. (Unlike plants or animals bred for a specific purpose,
whether by humans or anything else.)
<p>
There are attempts to explain what beliefs, desires, values, preferences, goals,
attitudes, likes, dislikes, ambitions, fears, etc. are within the framework of
Dennett's <i>intentional stance</i>. However such attempts cannot succeed,
because that framework (like the 'Knowledge Level' proposed by Allen Newell)
assumes that all things with those mental states, processes, etc. are
<i>rational</i> whereas humans and other animals obviously can have
such states without being rational.
<p>
Many of those internal states will themselves have been produced previously by a
combination of influences, including both previous choices made by the
individual, states and processes in the environment, and, of course,  the
initial state of the system, e.g. genetic mechanisms in the case of living
organisms.
<p>
We can then distinguish two cases:
<ol>
<li>
Most of your control decisions
(selections between possible options, whether internal or external)
made over a period of time are controlled by your own
<i>internal</i> components -- some of which may be involved in
determining which options are even considered, e.g.
when you construct alternative plans and then choose between them,
as happens in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/#dp0604">fully
deliberative systems</a>,
<p>
and
<p>
<li>
Most of the selections, or at least most of the major
ones that influence all the others, during that time period, are made by
<i>external</i> influences, such as strong winds, avalanches, or other
individuals pushing you around, making threats, or even tampering with
your brain.
</ol>
In the second case you can say that your behaviour was not free insofar
as other objects or other people produced selections and actions
that would not have been produced if you had not had the external
influences.
<p>
Of course, there is no <i>sharp</i> dichotomy of cases, but a spectrum
with many subtle discontinuities, like the difference between doing
something by mistake and doing it by accident, or the difference
between doing something intentionally and wanting to do it.
(See J.L.Austin for more examples.)
<p>
In case 1. you can say that you were free insofar as it was <i>your</i>
desires, beliefs, preferences, hopes, fears, values, plans, etc. that
selected what actually happened from among the alternative
possibilities.
<p>
Of course your desires, beliefs, hopes, etc. are themselves products of
a large collection of influences over many different time scales, some
going back over millions of years of evolution that made it possible for
you, unlike a flea, to consider complex future options and choose
between them. (The architectural requirements for that, which are
presupposed by some AI researchers, but are not always made explicit,
are summarised
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/#dp0604">in
this discussion of requirements for 'fully deliberative' systems
</a>.)
<p>
In this sense you are free to the extent that your decisions and actions
are mainly determined by <i>your</i> desires, tastes, preferences,
beliefs, hopes, fears, values, etc. rather than by other things.
<p>
What other kind of freedom could you wish for? Do you want to be able to
change all your desires, tastes, etc. at any time? On what basis?
Randomly? If they change randomly why call that freedom? If they are
not random what should determine them other than other desires, tastes,
preferences, etc.?
<p>
<b>
Worries about remote causes
</b>
<br>
Some people worry that even though what they do is the result of their
own desires, tastes, etc., these desires and tastes and the mechanisms
through which they influence decisions and behaviour are themselves
products of deterministic processes -- during our evolution, individual
development, etc.
<p>
So what: those prior determinants of what you are made it possible for
you to have kinds of freedom that clocks and most other types of animals
do not have. If you wish to be free and do not wish to have
deterministic mental mechanisms produced by prior deterministic
influences, then you are asking for something that is incoherent ---
it is logically impossible.
<p>
OK -- so you lack the freedom to have something incoherent. To that
extent you are unfree. But that's not a result of living in a
deterministic universe. If you were in a universe full of totally
undetermined occurrences you would not be more free, just more
unpredictable. Actually that may be an incoherent notion too, but that's
a topic for another day.
<p>
<b>
Some real limitations on freedom
</b>
<br>
Of course people may sometimes regret that they have certain desires and
wish they had others -- a common consequence of religious
indoctrination which sometimes persuades people that their healthy
biological desires are wicked even if they don't act on them (a
form of cruelty that should be
strongly opposed, like other aspects of
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/misc/pc-and-religion.html">mind-binding
cultures</a>).
<p>
Another sort of case is a person who wishes
he were  were not addicted to gambling, or
nicotine. In such cases changing to a new state can be very hard.
<i>People like that really do have their freedom restricted.</i>
Likewise someone who wants to be a concert pianist and plays beautifully
at home but collapses with nerves on the stage has his freedom
restricted, and may not be able to change easily. Sometimes a good
teacher or therapist can help. Or sometimes the change just happens
gradually after repeated attempts.
<p>
The fact that we <i>sometimes</i> have our freedom restricted does not
imply that we <i>never</i> do anything of our own free will (in the every day
or legal sense).
<p>
<b>
Internal freedom-restrictors
</b>
<br>
As some of the previous examples illustrate, it's
not only external influences that can interfere with your freedom.
A virus infection can make you so weak that you are as incapable of
doing certain things as you would be if somebody tied you up.
<p>
More subtly, there can be things in you, even things in your collection
of desires, that you would prefer not to have. Examples are addictions.
These  may be viewed as buggy products of mechanisms that are
highly desirable in other contexts. There are many complex designs that
have bad side-effects that arise out of unintended interactions between
parts, or between the mechanisms and certain sorts of environments.
<p>
It is very important for our well-being that physical processes can
alter our desires, e.g. when your body is short of water you have
mechanisms that detect that state and
produce a desire to drink, and that's just as well or you'd die.
Likewise, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, stress sensors,
exhaustion sensors, can all twiddle the contents of your current
collection of desires. That's not normally regarded as a loss of
freedom, but a requirement for a long and healthy life.
<p>
Some desires, such as the addict's desire for a smoke or an alcoholic
drink, or a shot of cocaine, or the addicted gambler's desire to make
another attempt to win, are not part of the functioning of the system
that is required for its well-being and, on the contrary, they can
shorten life and cause much misery. But the fact that they are internal
does not mean that the person who wishes to get rid of them can easily
do so: they may be much harder to get rid of than a virus infection or a
rope tying you to a tree.
<p>
There is much literature presenting
more complex cases, in plays, stories
and novels, and also in the clinical literature of psychiatrists and
psychoanalysts. Philosophers have also written many words about these.
<p>
These internal causes are important for the first two concepts of
freedom because they are relevant to what can and what cannot be given
as an excuse or mitigating circumstance either in ordinary personal
interactions or in the law courts. There may be no right or wrong
answers to where the boundaries should be drawn: those are ethical
questions that different cultures may answer differently.
<p>
This is not the place for a more complete discussion. My main point is
that addictions, hypnotic suggestions, virus infections, uncontrollable
desires to be violent produced by brain damage, are different from
your evolutionary history, your normal biological needs, your personal
hopes, likes, and ambitions, etc. Putting them all the same basket is
one step towards an incoherent notion of freewill.

<a name="counterfactuals"></a>
<h3><b>
The importance of counterfactual conditionals
</b></h3>
Implicit throughout this discussion is the assumption that it makes
sense to talk about 'what would have happened if...' E.g. if you had not
felt hungry you would not have taken a detour to the sandwich bar.
<p>
This notion has been the subject of huge amounts of philosophical
discussion, including discussion of whether that notion is consistent
with determinism.
<a name="kment"></a>
<blockquote>
For a recent example see
<a href="http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/115/458/261">
'Counterfactuals and explanation' by Boris Kment in <i>Mind</i>, 115, 458, April 2006.
</a>
<p>
There is a lot more philosophical literature including some very
complicated theories about possible worlds, causation, prediction,
explanation, probability, and the meaning of 'if'. A small selection is
referenced in Kment's paper.
</blockquote>
In particular there <i>appears</i> to be a conflict between determinism
and the first two notions of freedom, which can lead to fatalism, as
follows.
<p>
Suppose you have a choice to make, e.g. between staying in bed to help
yourself recover from an illness and going to work to give a lecture,
which may make the illness worse, but will help your students who have
an examination the next day. While you lie in bed thinking about the two
options you assume that there really are two options and your
weighing up the considerations will determine which of them is selected.
<p>
But if determinism is true then well before your final decision the
whole state of the universe determines what your decision will be.
Therefore your deliberations and your decision have no effect and the
freedom to choose is illusory.
<p>
This is a fallacious conclusion because when the action is selected
it is selected <i>as a result of</i> a process that <i>included</i> your
deliberations:
<i>If you had not gone through that process you might have
performed a different action.</i>
<p>
Suppose you decide to go to work and give the lecture, because the
examination is imminent and some students badly need last minute advice,
whereas the harm you do to yourself by lecturing while ill will have
more limited effects on you than failing an important
exam will have on students.
Then it is true that if you had not thought about the consequences of
cancelling the lecture, or if you had forgotten that there was an
examination the next day then you would have done something different,
e.g. staying at home on the doctor's advice.
<p>
All of this implies that some of the features of the situation before
you decided could have been different, so that it makes sense to ask
what would have happened if they had been different. However, 'things
could have been different'
<i>
is always relative to some context that
determines a set of constraints.
</i>
<p>
Obviously if the <i>only</i> such context you are willing to consider is
'everything being <i>exactly</i> as it was before you started trying to
decide', then in that situation you would not have reached a different
situation (unless it was a case where some random brain process, perhaps
based on quantum noise, played a significant role: but, as I keep
saying, randomness does not produce freedom -- there is more on that
below).
<p>
But we are perfectly capable of thinking about contexts that are not so
constrained. E.g. I happened to remember the examination, but I can
still reason about what would have happened if I had not remembered it,
because consideration of the examination played an important role in the
decision. So I can truly say that if I had not remembered the
examination I would have stayed at home.
<p>
Of course in that situation (my not remembering the examination)
something else must have been different -- e.g. the state of my brain or
the entry in my diary that caused me to remember the examination and
take it into account, or some external distraction that stops me
thinking of the examination.
But I don't need to know, or explicitly describe,
all the different possible states of the universe that might have left
me taking the decision without considering the examination.
<p>
I don't need that because I just know from experience that there are
lots of relatively small portions of the universe, like the digital
watch, and my brain, that at any time, could have been in
a different state without anything being badly broken: because the
structure of those mechanisms allows for those alternative combinations
of states, as the design of a digital watch allows me to make the hour
change without the minutes changing, though normally that doesn't occur.
<p>
We also know that some of those possibilities would have had only very
minor effects whereas others would have major effects, even if we can't
always tell which is which. In highly structured mechanisms, such as
digital watches and brains, the distinction may be much easier to make
because the causal pathways are far more constrained. It's different for
weather systems or ecosystems.
<p>
It may also be difficult to tell in brains which changes have big
effects and (because they are amplified in chaotic, non-linear, feedback
loops) and which have small effects (because homeostatic mechanisms
stop small perturbations from propagating).

<p>
<hr>
<h3><b>
How randomness screws up counterfactual conditionals
</b></h3>
Much is made above of the fact that there are many true counterfactual
conditional statements about what would or would not have happened if
something had or had not occurred.
<p>
The person trying to avoid opprobrium or punishment might argue that he
would not have stolen some medicine from a rich doctor if his
impoverished neighbour had not been on the point of dying, or if he had
had enough money to buy the medicines, or if the doctor had been willing
to help.
<p>
However if an effect is produced by a random mechanism then it makes no
sense to ask precisely what would have happened if something had been
different: all that can be truly said is that <i>some</i> selection from
the range of processes made possible by the structure of the device
would have occurred, and that selection would have had consequences.
<p>
A different view is taken by
some philosophers, e.g.
<a href="#kment">Kment in the paper cited above</a>, who argue that
counterfactual conditionals
regarding random devices can be true in cases
where the counterfactual assumption has nothing to do with the operation
of the device. E.g. if Fred selected the number 888 in a lottery, and a
'truly random' machine (if there can be such a thing) produces the
winning number 889, then Kment and many others would say that the
following is true.

<blockquote>
(A) <i>If Fred had selected 889 then he would have won.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
However I believe this is one of those indeterminate cases where there
are equally strong arguments for saying that that statement is not true
unless the antecedent is expanded as follows:
<blockquote>

(B) <i>If Fred had selected 889 and the machine had produced the same
result as it actually produced, then Fred would have won.</i>

</blockquote>
 I suspect many people unwittingly treat the extra conjunct in the
antecedent as presupposed by the question. But it does not have to be
presupposed.
<p>
If the machine is random and we don't restrict 'what if' considerations
to the cases where the result is stipulated to be the same then we have
no idea whether Fred would have won.
<blockquote>
(This amounts to the suggestion that attempts to make sense of
counterfactuals in terms of possible worlds and 'closeness' relations
should either exclude random devices whose operation makes a significant
difference to what happens, or else say that closeness of possible
worlds to the actual world must require all random devices with major
consequences to produce the same effect as occurred in the actual
world.)
</blockquote>
I am not trying prove that statement like (A) are false, merely to
suggest that it isn't clear whether they can be true. This is linked to
unclarity in the notion of randomness.

<h3><b>
Different notions of "different levels"
<br/>
<small>(Added 1 Aug 2008)</small>
</b></h3>
Not all differences of level are relevant to the points being made
here. A rectangular grid of dots on a sheet of paper can be
described at different levels, e.g.
<ul>
<li>
Describing each dot and its location
<li>
Specifying that there are rows of dots of particular lengths and
particular distances apart, and columns of dots of particular
lengths and particular distances apart.
<li>
Specifying that there is a rectangular grid of dots.
<li>
Specifying that the dots lie along diagonal lines.
<li>
Specifying that the dots form a regular pattern.
</ul>
However in previous cases we talked about different counterfactual
conditionals being true at different levels because there are causal
interactions at different levels, whereas these different
descriptions of the dot grid do not specify different sets of causes
and effects.
<p>
The important cases of levels of abstraction relevant to the
free-will debate depend on there being virtual machines at different
levels, in which causes and effects occur. For more on this see

<h3><b>
On conceptual analysis
</b></h3>
This is a very short position paper. I have referred to two coherent
concepts, but that should not be taken to imply that those concepts are
very precise, well understood, or easy to analyse. Both of them have
had many books and articles written about them, and there are a lot
of intricacies that I have ignored here. People who wish to go further
will have to devote a lot of time to learning to do analytical
philosophy: it is not easy.
<blockquote>

philosophy can be found in

Gilbert Ryle coined a label for the results of the kind of analysis that
describes collections of relationships, often unobvious and unnoticed
relationships, between collections of concepts, namely 'logical
geography'. I have tried to describe connections between that kind of
analysis, and a deeper analysis that identifies aspects of reality that
can support different logical geographies for the same 'terrain'. My
provisional name for the second sort of analysis is 'logical
topography'. The distinction is explained, and some misinterpretations
of the distinction countered, in this draft paper:

<b>History of this document</b>

My small additional contribution to what are essentially David Hume's ideas
was originally posted to an internet news group in 1988. I tried to show
how we can better understand the ways in which humans and other animals
or machines may have more or less freedom/autonomy/control/responsibility,
depending on their information
processing

This was originally posted to comp.ai.philosophy around 1989. A
slightly revised version appeared in <i>AISB Quarterly,</i> Winter
1992/3, Issue 82, pp.31-2.
<p>
In that note I tried to show how within the space of possible
designs for more or less sophisticated information-processing systems,
there are some with more opportunities to do things and some with fewer.
Evolution produced a very wide variety of designs, some with more
'freedom' some with less. There is no reason to believe that humans are
any kind of optimum, or that there is some coherent limiting case of
perfect freedom.

Daniel Dennett has written at least two books on this subject. If you
wish to see the arguments spelled out in much greater detail with more
examples, often in a highly entertaining fashion, read his
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262540428/002-0869395-4580828?v=glance&n=283155"> Elbow Room</a>
and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0670031860?v=glance">Freedom
Evolves</a>.
I have not yet read the latter, but he is always worth reading.
