<b>Background</b>
<br/>
The thoughts expressed here were originally triggered by comments in
the email discussion list of the
<a href="http://www.cphc.ac.uk/"> CPHC</a> (The Council of
Professors and Heads of Computing). This was
originally written on 20th December 2004.
Some afterthoughts can be found at the end.
<P>
We should all be elitists in the first of two senses explained below.
<P>
Words like 'elite', 'elitist' and more recently 'snobbish' have been
used from time to time in email messages, especially in connection
with discussions regarding
<a href="http://www.ukcrc.org.uk/">UKCRC</a> (the UK
Computing Research Committee 2009).
<P>
It seems to be assumed by many that being elitist is
inherently bad (even 'snobbish').
<p>
I shall argue, on the contrary, that there is a kind of elitism that
is valuable and should be vigorously promoted by ALL academics,
namely
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a concern for <I>quality</I> of research, teaching and learning,
<P>
<LI>a concern to increase the proportion of staff and students achieving
  <I>high quality</I> research, teaching and learning
<P>
<LI>a concern to allocate resources (including research funds) in such a
  way as to achieve those goals.
</UL>
<P>
Failure of some politicians, including government ministers, to
understand this seems to be based on muddled thinking about elitism, and
when this infects academics also it can do damage to the quality of what
we do and what we achieve, including the quality of discussions about
funding and management, where name-calling (e.g. 'elitist') should not
be a substitute for argument and analysis.

<P>
<B>[Digression:</B>
<br>
Compare the distorted semantics of the word 'liberal' in the USA.
According to a news report this morning (20 Dec 2004) the new UK home
secretary appears to have been infected by this tendency to use
'liberal' (admittedly preceded by 'woolly') as a term of abuse, when
responding to criticisms of his plans for identity cards, instead of
addressing the arguments. I don't know if that's just a one-off comment
or a sign of a dangerous additional mode of subservience to the USA in
the UK government.
<br>
<B>]</B>
<P>
As far as 'elitism' is concerned, muddled thinking can arise out of
a failure to distinguish two common uses of the word 'elite' as an
adjective (related historically to the adjectival uses of 'choice', and
'elect'), namely 'elite' meaning:
<P>
<OL type="a">
EITHER

<LI> <b>best at some task or activity</b>
    (e.g. art, music, athletics, mathematics, surgery, innovation,
    business, teaching, management, engineering design, nursing...)
<P>
OR
<P>
<LI> <b>belonging to some social group or sub-group</b> (e.g. the aristocracy,
    the rich, the powerful, the celebrities, etc.)
</OL>
<P>
The noun 'elite' is often used in sense (a) (e.g. talking about 'funding
for the elite' in the context of athletics), but the derived words
'elitist' and 'elitism' often tend to be linked with (b), usually with implied
criticism or disapproval.
<P>
What has happened recently is that politicians and others have come
to confuse caring about the elite in sense (a) with being elitist
in a sense related to (b).
<P>
Examples are UK government ministers (including the UK Home
Secretary in 2004, when he was previously in charge of education)
who justify high A-level grades on the grounds that the students
have worked very hard, and who descend to name-calling (using words
like 'elitist') instead of producing
<I>arguments</I> against people who point to evidence of lowered standards
because grades are awarded on the basis of inappropriate criteria.
<P>
[We have all seen results of this in the intake to university degree
courses, and we also now see a similar process in the grades we are
being forced by various pressures to award to our own graduates. The
last time I made that point some months ago on the CPHC discussion
list it triggered a version of the 'elitist' response.]
<P>
We should all be <B>unashamedly</B> elitist in a sense related to (a), namely
<P>
<UL>
<LI> being concerned about being able to distinguish high quality from
poor or mediocre quality achievements (e.g. in research, teaching and
learning -- and also government and academic management)
<P>
and
<P>
<LI>
supporting steps that attempt both to improve the quality achieved and
  increase the amount of high quality performance (whoever the
  performers are).
</UL>
<P>
<B>[Digression -- quality judgements:</B>
<br>
How to decide what high quality is without depending on personal whim,
or prejudice, can be discussed elsewhere, for instance in this
document
on criteria for evaluating various kinds of computing
research:
<blockquote>
<small>
<a href="cs-research.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/cs-research.html</a>
<br/>
I recently added a note on using scenario-based criteria for evaluating
difficult long term research programmes, such as some of the
<a href="http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/Grand_Challenges/proposals/">
UK Computing
Grand Challenges
</a>.
</small>
</blockquote>
<P>
Judgements of quality need not be just personal preferences but can be
related to agreed short-term and long-term research goals, though that
does not always happen. As Stevan Harnad has pointed out, the growing
use of citation-based judgements of quality presupposes the prior use by
referees and citing authors of a more basic kind of judgement. Moreover,
citations can be subject to fashion and we must be prepared to judge
quality independently of fashion.
<p>
<b>Note (added 3 Aug 2014)</b>
<br/>
In many practical contexts judgements of quality are related to what are
labelled "Meta-requirements" in
<small>

<br/>
(In retrospect I think 'Meta-functional requirements' might have been a better
label.)

Why we need to be elitist (type-a)
</B></H3>
There are contexts in which we would probably all be unashamedly elitist
in the sense described above. For instance I expect we all agree that
when people, including government ministers, need brain surgery, they
should be operated on by surgeons selected on the basis of depth and
breadth of knowledge and skill in judgement and performance rather than
on the basis of good intentions, strong desire to succeed, hard work or
the need to be fair to people who want to be surgeons.
<P>
Likewise designers of airliners, of software security systems, of
bridges, etc.
<P>
So certain jobs should go to the elite (in sense (a)),
for the good of all.
<P>
There is obviously nothing wrong with arguing that people on whose
competence others will depend, sometimes for their life, should be
assessed according to very high standards, and that when studying they
should also be given teachers and learning environments of very high
quality. Scarce resources and opportunities should go to the elite(a),
namely those who are best qualified and best able to make use of them
(especially where that produces benefits for all). But safeguards are
needed regarding how the elite in that sense are selected as
beneficiaries of public finance.
<P>
<H3><B>
Sometimes we don't need to be elitist (type-a)
</B></H3>
Where resources are not scarce or not very costly there is an argument
for distributing them to all who want them. (This used to be one of the
functions UK universities fulfilled by running 'extramural' education
departments, which gave free or low-cost evening classes to anyone who
wanted them. Many academics used to contribute some of their spare
time for this, but now they cannot afford to.)
<P>
When resources that are widely thought to be valuable and a general
right (e.g. heath services, or educational opportunities or
opportunities to do enjoyable and interesting low-cost research) are
scarce as a result of bad government policies, there is an argument for
urging changes in those policies, rather than restricting the
recipients. But there will always be difficult cases where the resources
required are scarce or expensive.
<P>
<H3><B>
How bad funding policies lead to distorted research fund allocation
policies
</B></H3>
It does not seem to be widely appreciated that in the UK the pressures
on decisions regarding resource allocations for research are seriously
distorted by inadequate university funding. That is because inadequate
funding produces pressure on university heads, and heads of departments,
to try to get as much external income as possible which causes many
universities to require <I>all</I> academics to be grant-getters in
order to keep their jobs. These forces also distort selection for
academic jobs in favour of people who are more likely to get grants,
even though many academics are perfectly capable of doing excellent
teaching and research without external grants, and would have done so in
the UK university system 20 years ago or more. (I started lecturing in
1962, and did not get a grant till about 1975, but nobody was
threatening me with loss of tenure, etc.)
<P>
The distortion is extremely unfair because while there are some people
who need equipment or collaborators to do their research, others, e.g.
some of the theoreticians, and some younger lecturers who need time to
continue broadening their education by attending seminars, reading, and
meeting people from other departments, may actually be hindered in their
research and development by the need to spend time on proposal-writing,
recruitment, management and other tasks related to project funding. Such
people may need time to get on with thinking and learning more than they
need staff, PhD students, equipment, or even travel funds.
<P>
Of course, the distortion is worse in departments where <I>most</I> of
the good research does not intrinsically require external funding, and
where funding sources are very scarce, e.g. in philosophy and many
humanities subjects.
<P>
The really nasty feature of this situation is that if <I>everyone</I> is
required to get grants in order to be allowed to keep their jobs or get
promoted, that makes it seem unfair
not to distribute grants evenly. So that
causes 'moral' or 'egalitarian' pressure to allocate grants on some
other criteria than likely effect on quality of research. (EPSRC partly
acknowledges this by having 'easier' access to research funds for people
in their first teaching job.)
<P>
The answer is NOT to press for grants to be distributed evenly
(anti-elitism), which would be a waste of public funds, but to remove
the universal requirement for all university staff (especially young
staff) to bring in grants.
<P>
But that requires a different funding model for universities. Making
this work may require reducing the number of universities where
most people are expected to do research, and where teaching is
research-led, and increasing the number of polytechnic institutions
where able and devoted teachers get on with their important jobs
free from unwarranted pressures to publish or get grants.
(That of course, is a distinction we used to have, but lost a decade and
a half ago.)
<P>
I wonder how many university heads of department understand this point,
and present the argument to senior managers, promotion committees,
politicians, etc., instead of harassing young colleagues with threats
of loss of tenure if they don't get grants, or even sacking them, as has
happened in some UK universities (and has been commonplace for longer in
American Universities.)
<P>
Part of the cause of the problem is something whose mention tends to
trigger accusations of 'elitism', namely the disastrous abolition of the
important and socially and economically useful distinctions of function
between universities (where most teaching was research-based)
and polytechnics (where most teaching was not research-based).
That abolition (Thatcher's
revenge on universities for not accepting her earlier proposal to
distinguish R and T universities) artificially increased the numbers of
people who were expected to get research grants, whereas in the previous
situation they were doing perfectly good, and useful jobs that did not
involve research -- and had higher teaching and admin loads accordingly.
(Even before the abolition of the divide, some polytechnic staff were
excellent researchers, and were able to apply for and get grants in
competition with university staff, but the others were not required to.)
<P>
It seems that some of the 'new' universities have faced up to this point
and started referring to themselves as 'polytechnic' universities, which
will help to make clear to students and others what their goals are and
which kinds of educational opportunities they offer.
<P>
Of course, where such a distinction of function exists, mechanisms are
needed to ensure that people, especially students, are not trapped in
the wrong part of the system, e.g. 'slipways' should enable students
easily to move between institutions if their performance indicates that
they would do better in a different one. (As argued here:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/gov/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/gov/</a>.)
<P>
<H3><B>
Alternatives to basing resource allocation on quality of achievement
</B></H3>
I expect nobody would argue that scarce resources and opportunities
should be allocated to some elite of type (b) e.g. a particular subset
of society defined by features that have nothing to do with the purposes
of the resources, e.g. status, gender, race, colour, family history,
connections with the rich and powerful, etc.
<P>
Yet when politicians (and others) cannot distinguish that sort of
elitism from the sort recommended here, it can get in the way of
sensible policy making.
<P>
There is, of course, a case for some positive discrimination where there
is evidence that the 'irrelevant' features have temporarily impeded
development of real potential to satisfy the requirements of capability
and performance. People who have been held back by ethnic, gender, or
regional causes of inequality
should be given a chance to progress without the impediments.
<P>
However, simply putting more people into a situation where they cannot
cope with what is required is no solution: it just causes general
reduction of quality, as has already happened in UK universities because
of a combination of drastically worsened teacher/student ratios and also
because of reduced entry requirements necessarily adopted to fill places
in order to maintain funding levels. That in turn produced pressure to
lower standards in university examinations in order not to increase
failure rates. An upper second class degree used to be an indication of
a level of achievement that could justify admittance to do research on a
PhD. Nowadays it would be foolish to treat PhD applicants as if
standards had been maintained.
<P>
Instead of simply widening access to university places or to research
opportunities, we need carefully designed mechanisms that
do not produce lower quality all round, as has happened to teaching
in UK universities over the last 20 years.
(See <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/gov/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/gov/</a>)
<P>
There is also a case for giving people a chance to establish what they
are capable of doing where they already have qualifications and
capabilities of a high order,
but have not yet had time or opportunity to
demonstrate that. EPSRC recognises this and has mechanisms with that
purpose. This is all elitist in the good sense.

<br>
I am aware that this is a topic on which vast amounts have been
written
(e.g. in philosophy and social and political theory) that I have not
examined.

<br/>
I  don't have time to attempt a proper literature survey. But I am willing to
accept criticisms and suggestions for amendments from people who have studied
more of the relevant literature than I have.
