Article Posted 23 Oct 1999 to comp.ai.philosophy on

    why some animals need an ontology which includes mental states
    of other animals (beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, etc.)

I believe this is closely related to JJ Gibson's ideas about
perception and affordances.

I'd like to propose an alternative way of thinking about this, which
I think is consistent with what I know about Daryl's views in
general, thought it's not what he has actually written, so perhaps he
simply hasn't considered this possibility. Or maybe he really will
disagree.

I'll argue that having and using an ontology in which the environment
contains other agents with mental as well as physical states and
processes is a natural and common biological phenomenon, for some types
of organisms.

In the very simplest organisms behaviours are produced by bundles of
reactive connections between sensory stimuli and motor signals.

In describing and explaining the behaviour of such an animal we may say
that it detects the presence of food and moves towards it. But we are
not implying that the animal has anything like the concept of food,
edible objects or even eating: it's just useful for us to describe it
that way. In that sense we say that plants may seek light, moisture,
etc.

More complex organisms need to analyse and interpret sensory input to
form some kind of categorisation of things in the environment, since how
to behave should be determined by what is out there (e.g. an edible
object, a predator, a shelter, an obstruction) plus the current state
(e.g. current needs and goals) rather than simply being determined by
current sensory stimulus patterns.

The relevant associations and principles could in principle all be
encoded in massive mappings between combinations of vectors of sensory
data and vectors of output signals.

But it will generally be more economical to learn and re-use
associations between more abstract, object-centred or
environment-centred phenomena, which can be explicitly encoded and
possibly retained as invariant while patterns of sensory stimuli
change: e.g. while moving round prey.

(Not everyone will find it obvious that something more than stored
input-output mappings will be needed for some organisms. But I won't
rehearse the arguments here: anyhow it is an empirical question, not
something to be be settled by an ideological commitment to a particular
view of AI or cognitive science.)

The latter more sophisticated type of organism requires the use of some
sort of ontology of objects, their properties, their relations, their
possible behaviours, possible actions that can be performed in
dealing with them, etc.

The ontology is implemented in the collection of possible internal
"invariants" referred to above. It will also include laws of behaviour
of those things: e.g. an unsupported object falls, a frightened rabbit
runs away, etc. How those laws are encoded and used in decision making
may vary enormously between different species.

In some animals (precocial species) the full ontology that the organism
needs to survive seems to be genetically determined and is available
from birth or hatching. Such animals are relatively independent from the
beginning. E.g. a newly hatched chick can peck for food (unlike a
newly hatched eagle), a newborn foal can find its way to the udder and
start sucking within hours, and most insects, many fish, etc. are
not looked after by parents, but feed themselves, find mates, etc.

In other animals (altricial species) it seems that the appropriate
ontology has to be built up by interacting with the environment:
possibly a long and slow process (hunting birds and mammals, animals
that climb and leap through  trees and need a rich grasp of spatial
structure and motion).

For the more sophisticated social animals the ontology used in dealing
with the environment can be quite abstract: i.e it is not simply a
matter of perceiving and acting in an environment with physical objects
and physical properties and relations. In addition there are *social*
relations (e.g. pecking orders, dominance hierarchies) and also mental
states of others. E.g. thinking about what another animal can see, or
what it is afraid of, may be helpful in determining how you stalk it if
you want to catch and eat it.

When we SEE someone else as happy, or sad, or angry, or submissive, we
are using the ability of our visual system to use an ontology including
such states. (People can LOOK happy or sad, etc. It's not just that we
see a curved mouth then reason that he must have such and such a
mental state.)

From this viewpoint, many animals need to use an ontology in which some
entities in the environment are edible, some dangerous, some rigid, some
flexible, etc. (think of JJ Gibson's "affordances").

Other animals have an even richer ontology in which there are other
"agents", i.e. organisms that can see, have desires, get angry etc.

In other words, for such animals, regarding others as having mental
states is NOT the result of some sort of philosophical argument, using
some kind of extrapolation "from myself to others".

Rather having an ontology which includes mental states of others is a
natural product of biological processes which produce biologically
competent organisms, and this is no different from having an ontology
which regards objects in the environment as having various causal
powers, such as rigidity, danger, graspability, etc.

This use of an ontology of mental states in OTHERS may even precede
being able to categorise one's OWN mental states and processes and
recognise their existence. E.g. it may be more important for an
individual to notice that someone else is easily made angry than to be
aware that it can also sometimes be angry.

Not all organisms will be like that: there are many trade-offs explored
by evolution, and very many different solutions to the problem of
survival and reproductive success. E.g. it seems that social insects,
such as ants and termites use much shallower ontologies suited to rather
rigid collections of reactive behaviours. But this could turn out to be
wrong: it's an empirical question.

If we build robots with human-like capabilities we shall probably have
to give them, or design into them the ability to develop, appropriate
ontologies including mental states of others, otherwise they will simply
be ineffective in an environment containing human beings and other
intelligent robots.

When such robots have suitably rich ontologies, and know how to apply
them both in thinking about others and in thinking about themselves, the
question whether they *really* have mental states will just be a silly
one.

By the way, I suspect that newborn human babies don't have the sort of
mentalistic ontology I've described. Instead they are born extremely
immature and are genetically pre-programmed with reactive behaviours
(e.g. reactions to human faces) which fool parents into thinking their
little darlings care about them. This is crucial in triggering the
appropriate nurturing and protective behaviour in adults which will help
the infant bootstrap an appropriate ontology while its brain is growing.

It's a delicate process and can go wrong in many ways.

I hope that makes sense.

Some of the ideas are developed further in papers in the Cognition and
Affect project directory, though there's a lot more work still to be
done.
