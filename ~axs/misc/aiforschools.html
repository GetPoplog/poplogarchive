What is Artificial Intelligence?
</h1>


<h2><b>
Introduction: What is AI?
</b></h2>

My colleague Russell Beale once suggested a useful introductory
definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for people who know nothing
about it:
<br>
<b>"AI can be defined as the attempt to get real machines to behave like
the ones in the movies."</b>
<p>
This may give an inkling of what a lot of AI research involves, but it
leaves out important facets of AI, especially its scientific aspects. No
short definition adequately captures the variety of research goals and
topics covered by AI, so I'll offer a description rather than a
definition.
<p>
AI is a relatively new discipline (born in the middle of the
20th century). It is increasingly frequently mentioned in newspapers,
magazines, on TV, in films, and in various kinds of computer
entertainments, yet it is not widely understood. Some people even
foolishly think it has already failed and been abandoned, whereas in
fact it is steadily growing in academe and industry, though the work is
not always labelled as "Artificial Intelligence". That is because some
of the important ideas and techniques have been absorbed into software
engineering.
<P>
Some other people equally foolishly make the opposite claim that AI is
progressing so fast that there is a danger that within a few years
robots will be taking over and perhaps keeping humans as pets. This
fails to take account of the really challenging difficulties in
understanding many of the capabilities of humans and other animals that
we cannot yet replicate in software systems or robots, for instance the
visual and motor control abilities of a squirrel in a tree-top or the
language learning capabilities of human toddlers.
<p>
AI is not taught or even mentioned in many schools and relatively few
universities offer undergraduate degree courses in AI. Yet it is a
central part of one of the most profound scientific and intellectual
developments of the last century: the study of information, how it can
be acquired, stored, manipulated, extended, used, and transmitted,
whether in machines, or humans or other animals.
<p>
Physics and chemistry study matter, energy, forces, and the various ways
they can be combined and transformed. Biology, geology, medicine, and
many other sciences and engineering disciplines build on this by
studying more and more complex systems built from physical components.
All this research requires an understanding of naturally occurring and
artificial machines which operate on forces, energy of various kinds,
and transform or rearrange matter.
<p>
But some of the machines, both natural and artificial, also manipulate
knowledge.
<p>
It is now clear that a new kind of science is required for the study of
the principles by which
<UL>
<LI>knowledge is acquired and used,
<LI>goals are generated and achieved,
<LI>information is communicated,
<LI>collaboration
is achieved,
<LI>concepts are formed,
<LI>languages are developed.
</UL>
We could call it the science of knowledge or the science of
intelligence.
<p>
This is what AI is about. Not only artificial systems, but also human
beings and many living organisms acquire, manipulate, store, use and
transmit information. They are also driven or controlled by it: e.g.
made happy by praise, made sad by bad news, made afraid by noises in the
dark, made jealous by seeing the behaviour or possessions of others, and
so on. From this standpoint it is not surprising that in recent years
the study of emotions has been growing in importance in AI.
<P>
So AI, despite its unfortunate name, is about natural information
processing systems as well as artificial systems, and not just about how
they perceive learn and think, but also about what they want and how
they feel. It has already had a profound impact on the study of human
minds.
<p>

<h2><b>
AI Overlaps with several other disciplines.
</b></h2>
If we construe AI in this way (as studying how information is acquired,
processed, stored, used, etc. in intelligent animals and machines) then
it obviously overlaps with several older disciplines, including, for
instance, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, logic, and linguistics.
<p>

What is new in AI is that the development of computers has given us new
ways of investigating the problems. Previously psychologists and brain
scientists could only observe and do experiments on existing information
processing systems, such as human beings and other animals; and
philosophers could only theorise in the abstract about how mind and
language ought to work. Now, however, we can go beyond those methods and
also "play God", that is we can design new kinds of working systems to
demonstrate the implications of our theories and check out whether they
can explain the facts they are intended to explain.

<p>
That new possibility arises because computers were designed specifically
to acquire, store, manipulate and use information, unlike older machines
which were designed to transform energy or apply forces to manipulate
matter or to produce chemical transformations.
<p>
Computers, unlike previous machines, enable us to express our theories
about how minds work in the form of working computer programs that
enable a machine to do some of the things people do, e.g. to
communicate, learn, solve problems, understand input from TV cameras,
control artificial limbs, etc.
<p>

<h2><b>
Some of the things we have learnt
</b></h2>
Designing machines with such capabilities has proved far more difficult
than many of the early researchers expected. In part that is because
many tasks which at first seemed simple turned out to have hidden
depths. For instance, seeing is not just a matter of recognising
patterns in visual images, but involves making sense of the environment,
including understanding all the many ways it can help or hinder us.
Similarly, the ability to understand and use a natural language, like
English, or French, or Urdu, turned out to be far more complex than some
of the early researchers thought.
<p>
To study and model these complexities, we have had to invent entirely
new ways of thinking about the processes involved, including developing
new languages in which to express the ideas, such as new kinds of
programming language. (AI researchers often find the languages used by
other programmers, e.g. Pascal, C, C++, Java, too restrictive.)
<p>
<h2><b>
Even "stupid" people have considerable intelligence
</b></h2>
This research has helped to reveal a great deal of shallowness in our
normal thinking about minds, consciousness, perception, learning,
language, and so on. In particular, we now understand that the kinds of
people we might normally describe as ``stupid'' are far more
sophisticated than any machine we currently know how to design.
I know of no robot which could be trusted to clear dishes and
cutlery from a dinner table and wash them at the kitchen sink, yet the
majority of people can do this, without being specially intelligent.
<p>
It has proved much easier to design and implement machines which do the
sorts of things which we previously thought required special
intelligence, like the ability to play chess, do algebra, or
perform calculations. These sorts of task fit more readily into a
computer's mechanisms for manipulating large numbers of precisely
defined symbols very rapidly, according to precisely defined rules.
<p>
We now understand much better that many commonplace human and animal
abilities (e.g. a squirrel leaping among branches of a tree, a bird
building its nest, a child listening to a story) involve a very deep
kind of intelligence and important and subtle kinds of knowledge, which
our theories do not yet accommodate. Likewise animal intelligence
includes things like desires, enjoyment, suffering, and various forms of
consciousness, all of which play an important role in their information
processing, but which we hardly understand as yet.
<p>
Many AI researchers are trying to find ways of extending the concepts,
theories, mechanisms and models in AI to include all those things. Their
work includes trying to find ways of programming computers so that they
have the kinds of richness and flexibility required for animal
abilities. The design of artificial neural nets, flexible rule
interpreters, and various kinds of self-organising software systems are
among the approaches being followed.
<p>
As mentioned above, some of us are also investigating ways of building
AI systems with the sorts of mechanisms involved in motivation, moods
and emotions, as well as the more obviously required capabilities like
perception, reasoning, problem solving and motor control. (My own work
in this area, along with work by colleagues, can be found
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">here.</a>)
<p>
It should be clear from all this that insofar as AI includes the study
of perception, learning, reasoning, remembering, motivation, emotions,
self-awareness, communication, etc. it overlaps with many other
disciplines, especially psychology, philosophy and linguistics. But
it also overlaps with computer science and software
engineering, because it includes the design of new kinds of information
processing systems, either to model those in humans or to solve
practical problems (e.g. software controlling a robot or factory, or
software helping a child to learn about arithmetic).
<p>

<h2><b>
Brains and computers: AI and neural nets
</b></h2>
Some people in AI have been impressed by the fact that the mechanisms of
brains are very different in detail from those in computers, even though
they may be doing similar sorts of things (storing, transforming, using
information). This has led to the investigation of neural nets
partly inspired by ideas about how brains work.
<p>
Some artificial neural nets have developed entirely as practical
solutions to engineering problems without much concern for accurate
modelling of brain mechanisms. More recent work attempts to move towards
more and more accurate models of real neurons, which are incredibly
complex and varied.
<p>
Some people think that it will never be possible to understand and
replicate all the important aspects of brain function unless we replace
computers with new kinds of machines, or perhaps build hybrid machines
using different technologies. This conclusion is premature. There are
two reasons:
<UL>
<li> We do not yet know what the real potential of computers will turn
out to be as we develop new types which are faster and smaller and can
be linked together in vast collections of cooperating systems
<li> There is much that we do not know about brains: including what
they do and how they do it.
</UL>
So we cannot yet say with confidence that there's ANYTHING brains can do
which computers will NEVER be able to do, even though there are many
things brains can do which existing computers cannot do (and vice
versa!).
<p>
<h2><b>
AI and simulated evolution
</b></h2>
Another recent development related to AI is work on simulated evolution.
Biological evolution managed to produce an enormous variety of living
organisms closely suited to different sets of needs in different
environments. By modelling those processes on computers it turns out
that we can sometimes get the computers to evolve solutions to problems
that we were previously unable to find.
<p>
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are increasingly being used both as a research
tool and as a means of getting computers to solve practical problems.
They use strings of symbols to encode specifications for designs, or
solutions to problems, in something like the way biological systems use
strings of molecules in DNA. Transforming and recombining portions of
strings enables an evolutionary computation to search for good designs
or good solutions, in a manner that is partly analogous to biological
evolution.
<p>
Genetic Programming (GP) extends these ideas by using structures which
are better suited to the problem than strings are. For instance, a GP
system may directly manipulate tree-like structures representing rules
or computer programs.
<p>
This work links up with studies in Artificial Life (Alife), which is
concerned with simulated evolution of various kinds of artificial
organisms, possibly competing or collaborating with one another.
<p>
Evolutionary techniques may use AI in the systems they evolve. Similarly
AI systems may use evolutionary techniques to help with some of the
harder problem solving tasks.
<p>
<h2><b>
AI and real evolution
<br>
Added 13 Aug 2018
</b></h2>
The Meta-Morphogenesis project, begun in 2012, triggered by the Alan Turing
Centenary celebrations, attempts to use computational ideas, including what we
have learnt from AI, but going beyond that, to investigate changes in
information processing in biological organisms between the very simplest
single-celled organisms (and possibly pre-biotic entities) and current organisms
of all kinds.
<p>
The project overview is here:

<p>
A major theme is evolution of biological construction kits of many kinds
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/construction-kits.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/construction-kits.html</a>
<p>
<h2><b>
Some implications
</b></h2>
This new multi-disciplinary field brings together a variety of old
disciplines in an entirely new way because we are constantly learning
new techniques for building <b>working</b> systems that extend and test
ideas and theories synthesised from the different disciplines.
<p>
This will have increasing practical importance as we continue to develop
more and more sophisticated information processing machines performing
more and more tasks (at home, at school, in factories, in offices, in
hospitals, on the internet...).
<p>
This research also helps us deepen our understanding of what we are, how
we relate to other kinds of animals and also how we relate to other
kinds of machines, including machines of the future, which may become
more and more like us. For example, by designing machines with various
kinds and degrees of autonomy we can clarify old problems about the
nature of free will. Instead of there being one kind of "free will"
which you either have or do not have, we find there are many different
kinds of freedom, and different people, different animals, and different
machines will have different subsets -- different kinds of freedom.
<p>
Some of them can then be seen to be more important than others. For
instance, it is important to have the freedom to resist external
coercion and take decisions and act under the influence of your
own desires, preferences, knowledge. It is not so important to have
the freedom arbitrarily and randomly to change your own desires,
preferences and knowledge.
<p>
These considerations are as relevant to some intelligent robots as they
are to humans and other animals.
<p>
<h2><b>
AI and Computer Science
</b></h2>
How does AI relate to computer science, another new discipline? In part
it is like the relationship between physics and mathematics. Mathematics
develops many concepts and techniques which physics uses, but the
central goal of physics is to understand the world, not to understand
those techniques. Likewise computer science (along with mathematics,
electronic engineering and software engineering) develops general
theories about information processing, and helps to create powerful
general tools (e.g. computers, operating systems, and compilers) which
are used in AI, but these are not the central focus of AI. The general
concepts, techniques and tools produced by computer science are used by
AI researchers in the process of studying something else, the kinds of
information processing capabilities which we find in many living
organisms, and which might also be created in new machines of many
kinds.
<p>
However, just as the history of physics includes many episodes where
mathematics was enriched by the work of theoretical physicists, so also
has AI had a great deal of influence on the development of computer
science. But equally it is having a deep impact on other disciplines
with which it is connected, especially philosophy, psychology and
linguistics. I think its impact on other disciplines will continue to
grow and diversify, including psychiatry, brain studies, biology, and
many forms of engineering.
<p>
<h2><b>
Studying AI at University
</b></h2>
<p>
Although AI degrees have been available in a few UK universities since
the early 1980s or earlier (e.g. Edinburgh, Sussex), until recently
there were very few universities which offered degrees with AI or
Cognitive science in the title.
<p>
However, since the mid 1990s the importance and interest of
the subject has been more widely recognized, and the number of
universities offering such degrees has expanded rapidly. In most cases
AI is not offered on its own, but in combination with one or more other
disciplines such as computer science, or psychology, or mathematics, or
an engineering subject, or an arts subject such as philosophy or
English.
<p>
I don't claim to have a complete list, but the UK universities that now
offer undergraduate degrees in AI (or in a few cases using other titles,
e.g. "Cognitive science, or "Intelligent systems") include the
following:
<br>
Aberdeen
Aberystwyth (Univ. of Wales),
Birmingham,
Durham,
Edinburgh,
Essex,
Exeter,
Hertfordshire,
Leeds,
Luton,
Manchester,
Middlesex,
Nottingham,
Oxford Brookes,
Royal Holloway (London),
Sheffield,
Staffordshire,
Sussex,
UMIST,
University College London,
Westminster
<br>
(That list was compiled in the Summer of 1998, and is probably out of
date by now.)

<p>
Degrees in computer science "with" AI (i.e. less than half of the degree
is AI) are available from several other universities, e.g.
Southampton.
<p>
Many degrees in computer science include one or two course in AI though
often these give only a narrow view of the subject. There are probably
also some psychology degrees which include some optional AI courses.
<p>
<p>
There are also some universities which offer postgraduate degrees in AI
or cognitive science (e.g. MSc, PhD) even though they don't offer
undergraduate degrees in this area.
<p>
Not all university teachers will agree with the view of AI presented
here, and it is likely that AI degrees will differ considerably in their
content because of different local expertise and different views of the
subject. E.g. some will be more engineering oriented and some more
science oriented. Some of the latter may be closely linked to
psychology, others to philosophy, logic or mathematics. Applicants for
university degree courses should therefore look carefully at what is on
offer before choosing.
<p>
<h2><b>
Entry requirements
</b></h2>

These vary considerably. Some places will require A-level mathematics,
while others assume that many really able students have the required
potential even if they have not studied mathematics formally. Probably
all require at least a C in mathematics at GCSE. Most will require at
least one science subject at A level.
<p>
Anyone who does a degree in AI must enjoy programming computers
as programming exercises and projects are likely to play a significant
role in the course. Because the programming tasks in AI degrees usually
involve attempting to give computers abilities or skills which humans or
animals have, students often find them more interesting than the
programming tasks computer science or software engineering courses.
<p>
However not all the degree courses require previous programming
experience, since very often someone with no such experience can learn
programming at university and do well.
<p>
Anyone who has not had previous programming experience and is
considering doing a degree in AI (or computer science) is strongly
advised to spend a little time learning programming not because that is
a pre-requisite but because it is a way of discovering before it is too
late that you don't like programming.
<p>
Usually courses in AI (and cognitive science) include more essay writing
than typical science or engineering courses. Some even include a chance
to study philosophical problems, e.g. about the relation between mind
and body.
<p>
<h2><b>
Employment prospects
</b></h2>
I have not done a systematic investigation, but my impression is that
students with degrees in AI find it easier than most graduates to get
jobs. They are as employable as computer science graduates. That is
because as computers become cheaper and more powerful the requirement
and the opportunities to give them more intelligence are growing
rapidly.
<p>
Many graduates with AI degrees go on to do research, sometimes after
switching to a related discipline such as psychology or philosophy.
<p>

In 1999 I was on a committee appointed by the UK Quality Assurance
Agency to produce a "benchmarking" document to be used by panels
assessing teaching in Computer Science departments. As part of the work
of the panel I produced, in consultation with a number of people at
other universities, a slightly more formal document than this one,
giving an overview of the scope of AI and some of its main features.

For a taste of an easy to learn AI programming language (Pop-11),
which we use at Birmingham, and is also used in the book by Sharples,
see
<a href="http://www.poplog.org">  The poplog/popforum home page,
</a>
maintained by Steve Leach (at Hewlett Packard research labs).
Pop-11 includes most of the programming constructs used in a variety of
other languages, so learning it provides a good introduction to a range
of AI languages and more conventional programming languages. Poplog
(including Pop-11) is now available free of charge for several types of
machines. See
