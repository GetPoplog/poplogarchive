I haven't thought much about pride, though I have thought about grief,
shame, embarrasment, guilt, anger, irritation, regret, excited
anticipation, carelessness, and several others.

That could take you an awfully long time.

I've just added some new ones to the Cognition and Affect project
directory.
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/

I'll be discussing related topics (robots in love?) at a literary
society meeting I have (foolishly?) agreed to give a talk to on 21st Feb
at the RFH. See

The approach is based on the assumption that everything depends on the
underlying architecture -- to be more precise the information processing
architecture.

(This is not necessarily a physical architecture: just as a complex
software system can have an architecture which is not a physical
architecture, though it is *implemented* in physical mechanisms).

When you know what sort of architecture is implemented in the brain
of an animal or machine you can (if you have a good theory) work out the
possible states and processes that can be supported by that
architecture.

(E.g. think of how the periodic table of the elements, based on a theory
of the architecture of matter, generates a systematic collection of
types of "elementary" stuff, which when combined with more architectural
detail, a theory of valency and chemical bonds, generates an even larger
variety of types of chemical compounds, and processes in which compounds
get transformed.)

At present we have only fragments of a theory of types of architectures
and the processes they can generate. We can make progress by
simultaneously working top down trying to "unpack" familiar types of
mental states and processes (e.g. using philosophical methods of
conceptual analysis, and some kinds of psychological research) and also
bottom up trying to work out what sorts of architectures are implemented
in brains and other mechanisms and what they can do. (This needs to be
related to the evolution of human-like brains: our architecture reflects
much of our evolutionary history.)

If we are lucky, the top down and bottom up approaches will meet up in a
fruitful way (as I am already beginning to find in discussions with
brain scientists).

A few thoughts on pride, provoked by your message.

Pride is a fairly sophisticated and subtle collection of states and
processes involving

o long term attitudes (taking a pride in one's work, being proud of
  being a Brum),

o relatively short term moods (sharing the pride of one's football team,
  or nation, or family during a day of celebration of some triumph or
  recognition),

o emotional states (a thrill of pride when your child wins a race, or
  your team beats another more famous team, or a distinguished person
  praises your achievement...).

These all involve some kind of high valuation of oneself or something
one is associated with or associates oneself with. It's a valuation both
in relation to how one values others, and also how one thinks others
evaluate one.

In some cases this evaluation can be distorted, e.g. people value their
family or their class or their skin colour or their achievements more
highly than those of others and wrongly think that that evaluation is
justified and should be shared by everyone.

Then there's a more active kind of pride which has to do with reasons
for taking decisions or performing actions, e.g. refusing help,
rejecting pity, not wanting to show your fear or other weaknesses, or
being too proud to admit that....

What all this implies is that having the full range of varieties of
pride involves a very sophisticated cognitive and motivational
architecture including lots of beliefs about achievements of oneself and
others, the qualities of oneself and others, the appreciation or
recognition of those qualities and achievements by others, and beliefs
about sorts of actions or happenings which can affect that recognition.

Alongside beliefs it also requires desires of various sorts, including a
desire to achieve or preserve that recognition (= fear of losing it),
desires to take actions which will enhance it, or draw attention to it.

It usually also involves not just the belief that others value one's
qualities and achievements but also pleasure in the fact that they do.

These combinations of beliefs and desires (and other things) can
interact with all sorts of other information in forming attitudes and
and decisions in various more or less subtle ways.

Some of this can happen relatively unselfconsciously.

However, the human architecture also includes various abilities to be
aware of internal states and processes and to experience pleasure and
pain (things which I don't think have yet been adequately analysed). So
some kinds of pride include these additional self-reflective states and
processes.

Some emotional states involve partial loss of control of attention and
thought processes, e.g. the person who wallows in the pride of his
achievement and cannot put it out of his mind in order to get on with
his work, or a task of thinking about someone else's needs.

(That presupposes an architecture in which one is sometimes in control
of ones attention and thought processes: you can't lose control if you
never have it. I don't think that's possible for a rat, or a newborn
baby, or the simplest sorts or robots of the future.)

I think all of the kinds of pride (or most of them?) involve some kind
of awareness of other agents with values related to ones own.

Without that relation to a social group, one could feel pleased with
oneself, relieved at having achieved a difficult and possibly dangerous
goal, self-approving in various ways, etc. but I don't know that we'd
regard those states as examples of "pride".

However these questions about the boundaries of pre-theoretical concepts
are often unanswerable: the concepts are inherently indeterminate (like
the concepts of "water" and "air" prior to the development of the atomic
theory of matter.)

The upshot of all this in relation to questions such as whether pride
could occur in a machine is that it would require a whole lot of other
things to be in place in the architecture before there's any chance of
pride occurring. The requirements for perception, belief, and desire are
much simpler.

E.g. I suspect that many animals have quite complex mental states and
processes without being capable of most of the above kinds of pride, if
any, e.g. ants, dragonflies, rats, birds. I am not sure about chimps and
gorillas: it's very hard to tell what sorts of categories they use in
their thinking especially their self-evaluations.

I am fairly sure that a newborn human infant is incapable of pride,
whereas within a couple of years the architecture and the conceptual
framework has developed sufficiently for certain kinds of pride (a two
year old can, in a simple way, be proud of his/her appearance or
achievements, but not proud of one's nation, for instance!).

Further analysis could perhaps point to kinds of brain damage which
would remove the capacity for various kinds of pride by removing some of
the kinds of capabilities on which they depend: e.g. the ability to
consider how one is evaluated by others.

The architectural requirements for the ability to have or experience
pride are closely related to requirements for shame, humiliation, guilt,
embarrassment, and other things. Most mental states come in elaborate
families and cannot occur in isolation.

Well enough of my rambling. That's just a brief sketch from a "top
down" point of view. A lot more would have to be said about the kinds of
information processing architectures which could do all that. But that's
a very long story, involving a lot of ongoing research with only partial
and provisional results.

Is this relevant to what you wanted? Feel free to phone me at home in
the morning if you wish.

Subject: Monday

Dear Journalist,

It occurs to me that if you wish to regard pride as one of the sins,
that would rule out reasonable or justifiable pride, such as

    Taking pride in one's work, because it is well done.

The cases where pride can be foolish, wicked, unjustified, or counter
productive include things like.

1. Being too proud to ask for help, e.g. for fear of humiliation

2. Concealing one's needs, afflictions, inadequacies, poor performance,
out of pride, e.g. for fear of being exposed, or thought ill of

3. Being proud, haughty, condescending to others, e.g. because they are
thought to be (or they are) inferior.

4. Over-valuing oneself, one's family, one's country, etc.

5. Taking credit for something one has no right to be proud of because
it was all done by others, or a result of luck, etc.

6. Being unwilling to admit error, apologise, accept blame, make the
first move in a reconciliation. (Too pround to...)

Some of these states depend on awareness of one's own vulnerability.

Most involve the ability to think about how others think of oneself, and
wanting to be rated highly.

Most/all involve the notion of some kind of social ranking, or ranking
in levels of approval by society, colleagues, acquaintances, etc.

And maybe more.

I once, as a child, had a dog: a black and white mongrel called Spotty.
I remember an occasion when we were out walking. A much smaller dog came
rushing out of the garden of a house we were passing, barking furiously
at Spotty, causing Spotty to run away with his tail between his legs.
The other dog then stopped and strutted back. I thought the episode
extremely funny and stood laughing loudly. Spotty turned, looked at me,
then walked off limping, as if he had been hurt. But the other dog had
not got near him. A short time later something distracted him and he
stopped limping.

I don't really know what was going on, but at the time I thought he had
felt humiliated by my laughing at him (a blow to his pride???) and he
had tried to regain my sympathy by feigning injury.

Who knows what was actually going on in that brain?

I see the current issue of New Scientist has an article on deception by
animals.

Subject: Reply to: Thanks for your time

Journalist,

Thanks for your message, and also for putting so much effort into this.

This is NOT true of all emotions, but is true of the (evolutionarily
new) sorts of characteristically human emotions that interest me (grief,
infatuation, jealousy, excited anticipation, apprehension,
embarrassment, shame, etc. etc.).

    [[Note: I now call these tertiary emotions. There are also
    primary and secondary emotions. (A.S.)]]

As you have probably already grasped these all require:

    1. Sophisticated cognitive capabilities, including

       1.a. deliberative capabilities
            the ability to create and consider and evaluate
            new possibilities, e.g. for what might happen, for
            actions, for things to say, etc.

       1.b metamanagement capabilities
            the ability to monitor one's own state, to evaluate it,
            to (attempt to) change it.

    2. Various control mechanisms which run independently of high
       level decisions.

Some of them also require awareness of being part of a social system.

Some of them require acceptance of an external system of values, going
beyond one's own personal desires, preferences, etc.

Remember that the word "emotion" is multiply ambiguous (57 varieties?)
and is used by different people to refer to different things. Most
psychologists who study emotions do not focus on the above. Poets and
playwrights and some sorts of therapists do.

I allow that the word "emotion" also refers to evolutionarily older
states and reactions, e.g. nausea produced by a horrible smell,
paralysing terror, being startled, sexual reactions, and perhaps others
which we may share with rats and other animals which are not capable of
the sophisticated "new" emotions.

What I say about these *older* emotions is different from what I say
about the *newer* human emotions. In particular a subset of the older
ones may be pre-programmed genetically via patterns and reactions in the
limbic system and perhaps other mechanisms. I.e. they may depend on
specific "emotional" mechanisms as opposed to emerging from the
interactions of a variety of other mechanisms required for intelligence.

Another important point which we did not discuss is that there's a
difference between *having* an emotion (being in an emotional state) and
*feeling* the emotion, though most people unthinkingly assume that if
you have one you feel one.

That's not so: a person can be angry or infatuated or envious without
realising it. It can be very clear to all their colleagues or friends
however. This is commonplace in plays and novels because it is
commonplace in life.

Yes, but it could *be* hassled without *feeling* hassled.

That requires the meta-management (self-monitoring) facilities to detect
the state. The state could occur and go undetected. In fact part of the
emotional education of humans is helping them to detect and classify
some of their emotional states, so that they can begin to manage them
better.

The simulated nursemaid I showed you was not capable of *feeling*
hassled even when it *was* hassled (i.e. when it could not cope with the
flood of new motives, when there were too many babies all getting into
trouble at once).

(Incidentally the nursery scenario allows more kinds of troubles than I
showed you: e.g. in an over-crowded room thuggery can develop!
However the implementation of this is still very shallow).

Ian Wright's more sophisticated nursemaid, which I did not show you,
could *detect* that it was hassled and react by raising its attention
filter threshold.

You could regard that as a primitive form of "feeling hassled" going
beyond merely being hassled.

But it had no capacity to find that state unpleasant: it merely reacted
by taking pre-programmed action to remedy the state. Experiencing
something as pleasant or unpleasant requires more sophisticated
mechanisms than those we discussed, and my ideas on that are still very
vague.


So, I'd rephrase what you wrote, without the word "feel" as:

OK?

Yes, but that's just one facet of what's going on. The other facets
include

1. The motivations, the beliefs, the perceptions, the decisions, which
lead up to that state.

2. Further facets which arise from the agent detecting the state,
evaluating it, and possibly trying (often in vain) to do something about
it. This in turn can escalate into yet more frustration, annoyance, etc.
about *oneself*. (E.g. you notice that your mind is constantly drawn
back to that humiliating episode and decide to resist it because it is
interfering with other things. But despite trying to resist it you fail,
and continue to dwell on it. Then you notice that that is happening and
you get annoyed with your self for not coping better. Emotions can
pile-up.)

Summary:

Some "OLD" emotions may have genetically programmed emotion mechanisms,
e.g. freezing in terror. I have mostly ignored those, not because they
are uninteresting but because I thought enough had been said about them
by other people (e.g. Joe le Doux)

The "NEW" emotions are far more complex and in at least some cases are
not direct consequences of explicit emotion mechanisms but rather emerge
from interactions of multiple subsystems concerned with motivation,
deliberation, attention, evaluation, etc.

What the "new" and "old" emotions have in common is that there's some
(possibly partial) loss of control.

(The loss can be dispositional: it doesn't manifest itself unless
certain circumstances occur, e.g. being reminded of one's dead child.)

> the nursemaid has an understanding of what a good job is compared to a
> bad job.

There may be different sorts of pride in one's work, accessible to
different sorts of animals (or artifical agents) of varying
sophistication.

For a non-social animal there may be awareness of the fact that jobs can
be done well or badly, one in time to meet some need or too late to meet
the need, done with a lot of effort or with little effort, etc.

If those cases can be recognized and discriminated, then on completion
of a job which has been done well, in time, with little effort, etc.
there may be a period of assessment when the quality of the achievement
is recognized. This is one form of taking pride in one's achievements.

(This assessment of a job as well or badly done could be part of an
adaptive mechanism feeding back into weights which will affect choices
in future activities, for instance. I.e. it's a pre-requisite for
certian kinds of learning.)

A further level of sophistication would be the ability to remember the
evaluation of *previous* performances and the ability to detect whether
things are getting better or worse. An animal which could detect that
there is a steady improvement over several tasks may get additional
satisfaction from a job well done, over the simple recognition that it
was well done. I have no idea which animals other than humans can do
this comparison with past performances.

For a social agent an additional factor may be comparison with how
*others* perform on similar tasks. I.e. one can evaluate one's
performance in relation to how well others are perceived to perform on
similar tasks.

Where the performance involves direct competition (competing for
a mate or fighting over some food) the recognising achievement of the
task itself involves the comparative assessment (I got it, he didn't).

In other cases more sophisticated cognitive abilities are required if
one's own performance is to be compared with others. Do birds consider
whether the nest they have built is better than the one built in the
next tree? Do they consider whether their chicks are bigger, or more
numerous, than those in the next nest? I doubt it.

Yet another level of sophistication involves thinking about how *others*
evaluate one's performance, and how they rank it. I may be able to tell
that I am doing better than another individual without having the
conceptual sophistication required to think about whether other people
think I am doing better than that individual. For agents which have that
conceptual sophistication there may be a recognition that others in the
group rank them highly.

This recognition may or may not lead to further internal processes, e.g.
a glow of satisfaction. This requires not only detection of the fact
that one is ranked high, but also evaluation of that fact as good or
bad.

So, depending on its cognitive sophistication, an agent may be able to:

    evaluate a current performance
    compare the current performance with previous performances
    compare its own performance with those of other agents
    think about how other agents compare/rank its performance

and so on... These would constitute different forms of pride in one's
performance.

You are forcing me to try to design very complex explanatory mechanisms
in a short time, and I am very likely to make mistakes!

However I hope my comments above help to show that there are different
types of recognition of how well one has done, involving different kinds
of cognitive and evaluative capabilities, and in complex cases these
interact in intricate ways.

I don't think instructions to oneself to feel good could achieve
anything directly. However there are explicit evaluations of states as
good or bad, and that is part of what it is to feel good or bad about
those states.

(Self evaluation is a complex phenomenon on which I am still not very
clear.)

If you are finding some of this hard to understand, it's not your fault,
because
    (a) the theory is complex and difficult
    (b) it is still patchy and unclear in many places


> Then there are the emotions that require a knowledge of self and
> status within a social group--such as being too proud to talk to

That in turn subdivides into various different cases, e.g.

    You don't want to admit to that person that you were wrong
        even though you now realise you were

    You don't want to talk to someone you think is of very low
        status and with whom any sort of contact would be
        degrading, or somehow contaminating. (The ability to think
        like this may depend on living in a culture with certain
        sorts of norms. I suspect you and I could not possibly be
        in this sort of state.)

    You don't want to be seen by others to be talking to a person
        of low status, etc. because etc etc.

and more besides.

                      ^^^^

If we replace the word "feel" above with "have", the question is about
what sorts of states are involved in having other emotions. Yes, I have
thought about and discussed a number of other cases with colleagues and
students.

In general it is unprofitable simply to think about a particular
emotion. Rather, in order to understand any particular case you have to
think about a range of cases and how they are similar and how they are
different.

For example, I might ask a student to analyse and compare these:

    X is angry with Y
    X is irritated with Y
    X regrets what Y did
    X wishes Y had not done that
    X is angry/irritated etc. with himself

or
    X regrets doing A
    X is embarrassed about having done A
    X is ashamed of having done A
    X feels guilty about doing A

or
    X admires Y's house
    X would like to have a house like Y's
    X is envious of Y because of Y's house
    X is obsessively envious of Y

or
    X loves his children, wife, family, etc
    X loves his country
    X loves his job
    X loves ice cream
    X loves skiing
    X is in love with Y
    X is infatuated with Y

or
    X is afraid that Y will happen
    X is terrified that Y will happen
    X is apprehensive about Y
    X is nervous about Y
    X is cautious because Y may happen
    ....

or
    X likes/enjoys looking at Y
    X finds Y beautiful
    X finds Y impressive
    X finds Y awe-inspiring
    X finds Y sexually attractive
    X finds Y interesting, unforgettable, ...
    X cannot help staring at Y (even though Y is horrible) ...

Not all of these are emotions.

I could try to dig up some old notes on anger and related emotions, i
if you are interested.

[[ Now in

quirks???

The "old" primeval emotions come not from mechanisms with resource
limits but from rapid global effects of powerful "alarm" mechanisms
(e.g. the limbic system). Emotions involving global interrupts are the
ones most studied by psychologists and brain scientists, I think.

In humans it looks as if this mechanism can be trained to produce new
kinds of reactions and to do so in relation to new kinds of things. (I
think a lot of religious indoctrination is based on this.)

So the architecture supports different sorts of states which are called
"emotions" in ordinary language. It's only a subset of those states
which involve perturbance i.e. actual or potential loss of control of
attention. I happen to be interested in those partly because I want to
know what it is to be in control of thought processes. (Which I assume
chickens and new born babies are not).

I.e. the perturbant emotions are specially interesting to me not as
emotions but as something that has to be explained by a theory of the
high level control mechanisms in a human mental architecture.

When you *feel* sad, angry, hassled, excited about your friend's
arrival, infatuated, that's because your self-monitoring mechanisms have
detected and classified your state.

In most cases this does not involve sensory actuators and it need not
involve pleasure or pain apart from the evaluation that is already there
in the state detected.

In some cases sensory actuators are involved. When grief makes you cry
you will experience the physical/physiological processes involved in
crying. But there is far, far more to grief than crying or any other
physical manifestation which may be detected by physical sensors.

I hope my comments about the old emotions answer that. I don't know
details, but I presume the limbic system has various global control
capabilities which account for some of the things you are talking about.

There may be other more subtle things like reactive mechanisms which for
some reason keep intruding on the deliberative layer. E.g. if there's a
rumbling noise in the background it may be of no concern to you and you
may be able to shut it out. But under some circumstances you keep
finding your attention drawn back to it as something needing
explanation. This might go via some sort of anomaly detector which is
not part of the global control system (required to make you freeze,
flee, change direction, etc. etc.), but still has the ability to attract
attention.

I think itches and various bodily desires work like that. As they grow
more and more intense they gain in their ability to attract attention
(interrupt the deliberative mechanism). I.e. they acquire higher
insistence in my terminology. I don't see any need for them to go
through any global alarm system (the limbic system) unless states are
detected which are potentially life threatening, or whatever.

Whether these should or should not be called emotions is a matter of
taste. Some people would and some wouldn't.

I don't care either way: the labels are not important, only what the
phenomena are like in detail and how they fit into the explanatory
framework provided by the architecture.

I have a suspicion that I have answered at too much length to be of any
use to you. Does it help?

Subject: Re: Pride... at last

Thanks for letting me see your draft. I am sorry I could not respond
earlier: I have had a visitor today.

I have some comments on your questions, and some suggested changes
to your draft.

I don't think Rodney Brooks has read my proposals.

Anyhow there's nothing particularly rigid about my
structures as far as I know -- the whole point is to
provide increased flexibility. The remarks you quote
from him sound as if they were based on his seeing a very
short summary.

Most of the main features I postulate
correspond only to well documented human abilities
(e.g. we definitely do have long term associative
memories, we do have motives and desires, e.g.
you really do want to write this paper (I think),
we definitely do make plans (e.g. you planned in
advance to write the draft then send it to me for
comments). We can notice things about our thinking
(e.g. you have expressed a negative judgement about
your thoughts expressed in your final paragraph.)

And of course we have reactive mechanisms, including
well known reflexes of many kinds and
startles, etc.

So when I talk about evolution having produced such
things I am not going far beyond common knowledge,
and I am not saying that evolution is *constrained*
to produce these things (e.g. it solved the survival
problems differently in bees and termites).

Moreover, my papers have been so *vague*
about the interactions between the layers that I
can't see how they *constrain* evolution.

That's a serious weakness in my work: the vagueness
still needs to be removed. Until then, it's just a
very schematic and incomplete specification of one
region of design space.

Some of Rod's followers make a different point.
I am suggesting that animal brains implement a
fairly *modular* structure combining a variety
of identifiable functionally distinct components.

The alternative view (strongly represented
at Sussex University) is that evolution produces
an unintelligble mish-mash of relatively simple
reactive behaviours, which works nevertheless.

The first thing to say is that nobody knows, and
the people who are dogmatic on one side or the other
of this issue are just that: dogmatic. We have to
keep an open mind.

I say in many papers that my proposed architecture
is merely one sort of possibility in a space of
designs and we have to understand what that
space is like, what alternative possibilities there
are and what sorts of trajectories can occur
through the space.

Secondly I have suggested that contrary to the
Sussex/Brooks view there may be reasons why
evolution would favour a modular structure rather
than an unintelligible mish-mash when it is
creating something with a very large collection
of capabilities.

That's because (a) in some cases the un-modular
system would require far more storage than
something composed of re-usable re-combinable modules;
and (b) the ability to do without deliberation, planning,
etc. (the functionality of my second layer) would
require a far longer period of evolution to create
explicit solutions to the need to cope with the
same variety of contexts.

This is a very short summary of a more complex
argument, which still needs to be spelled out
more fully than I have managed so far. The
argument may have flaws, but as far as I know
it has not even been considered by the defenders
of the Sussex/Brooks position (excellent researchers,
friends of mine, etc. but sometimes too narrow and
dogmatic!!!)

The Sussex position is based partly on their own
very interesting evolutionary experiments in which
they evolved circuits capable of performing rather
simple tasks. The circuits worked but were very
hard to understand, and did not seem to have any
clearly identifiable modules with well defined
functions. They extrapolate from this to the claim
that animal brains may be similarly unstructed and
unmodular.

But that's a totally unjustified leap from very
simple systems to far more complex systems. My
arguments for the evolutionary value of modularity
depend on the complexity and the variety of
capabilities in diverse situations.

I think it is usually not helpful to ask:

    Could machines etc. do so and so?

Instead always ask:

    How could they do so and so?

The first question is an invitation to undisciplined and premature
speculation. The second is a request for reasoned arguments and
explanations.

As far as your question is concerned my undisciplined, wild speculative
answer is: I don't see why not, since (some) humans did and we are
therefore an existence proof of possibility.

As to HOW it happened, that's a far more interesting question, and it is
part of a more general question about how values evolve. I don't have
any kind of nice short answer to that. I suspect it's another one of
those simple looking questions which have a very complicated answer.

I hope that this sort of work will give people a deeper understanding of
what we are!

You've had a hard task, and I am impressed that you've managed to
compress so much into such a short space. I think the compression
has produced some minor infelicities and inaccuracies so in what
follows I've suggested a changes which I hope are helpful.
I've also added explanatory comments for you in parentheses, not for
inclusion in the text.

I hope it all makes sense.

Best wishes.
