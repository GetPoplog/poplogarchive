<b>My main research themes since about 1959 (after switching from maths to
philosophy):</b>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:10px; width:700px">
Attempting to defend Immanuel Kant's claims (1781) that mathematical discoveries
are
(a) non-contingent
<br>
Meta-ethics, including the primacy of "better" over "good", "ought", "right",
"should", "best", etc.
<br>
Rejection of reward-based theories of value, preference and motivation.
<br>
Functions of vision, including uses of visual mechanisms in multi-layer
perception, and mathematical reasoning.
<br>
Information processing architectural requirements for intelligent agents
including support for varieties of cognition and varieties of affect, e.g.
pleasure, pain, wanting, fearing, love, grief, mechanisms for motive generation
and motive management: links with stages in evolution of intelligence. Rejection
of reward-based theories of motivation.
<br>
The structure of
<i>The space of possible architectures for autonomous agents</i>, including
evolved architectures. Virtual machines and phenomenal consciousness.
<br>
The importance of virtual machinery for natural and artificial intelligence.
<br>
Evolution of richly structure internal languages used for perception, learning,
reasoning, planning, predicting, explaining, controlling actions, wondering
whether, wanting, fearing, etc., etc. long before use of languages for
communication.
<br>
The "Space of possible minds", including minds produced by biological evolution,
for increasingly complex organisms.
<br>
Trying to understand why it is so hard to get computers to reason and learn in
the same way as ancient mathematicians, e.g. Archimedes, Euclid, Zeno, etc.,
(and also pre-verbal toddlers and other intelligent animals)
with implications for philosophy of mathematics.
<br>
Design of AI environments for learning and teaching.
<br>
The main aims of science: discovering what is and isn't possible, what makes
things possible, why some things are impossible. Emphasising the search for
regularities leads to shallow or bad science.

Since 2011, working on the (unfunded) Turing-inspired Meta-Morphogenesis project
