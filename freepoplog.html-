In July 2019 Steven Leach, who originally encountered Pop-11 and Poplog as an
industrial user working for GEC then Hewlett Packard research centre, and made
several important contributions to poplog, including the Objectclass (Object

<p>
The download package and installation scripts (which include an executable
'basepop11' and build a standard set of 'saved images' that can be run) should
work on either 32-bit linux or 64-bit linux, provided that you have installed
the packages (listed below) required for linking and running 32-bit
applications, and have the required 32-bit X window libraries, including
'development' versions of libX11, libXt, libXext and (open)motif or failing that
lesstif.

<small>
Previously the editor Ved worked reliably only in xterm and PuTTy
windows. Other console programs claiming to emulate xterm (vt100) screen
handling, failed to cope properly with the window update optimisations,
e.g. when scrolling part of a screen. Disabling the screen optimisations
by default now enables Ved to be used in a wider range of console
windows including gnome-terminal and urxvt (and related programs).
<br/>
The change requires more refreshing of the whole screen, but does not
seem to be noticable with current computing and networking speeds.
<br/>
The change does not affect Poplog's graphical multi-window editor, XVed.

WHAT IS POPLOG?
</b></h3>

<div style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
<b>Links to information about Poplog/Pop11/Prolog/Lisp on Wikipedia</b>
<br/>
Poplog is an integrated toolkit providing a highly extendable
collection of languages and tools for teaching, research and
development. It is described on Wikipedia
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplog">here.</a>
By default it includes
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_compiler">incremental compilers</a>
for three powerful AI programming languages which can be used
interactively both when learning to program and when developing
software:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP-11">Pop-11</a>--the core
language -- used to implement itself and the others;
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_lisp">Common Lisp;</a>
and
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog;</a>
</ul>
as well as
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">Standard ML,</a>
a widely used functional language.
</ul>
<p>
Other languages have been developed in Poplog by users, but are not
part of the default
system. There are also extensions to Pop-11, providing language
features that are not part of the core language, but are immediately
available to users, including
<ul>
<li>
<a href="doc/objectclassteach/objectclass_example">Objectclass</a>,
an Object-Oriented programming extension, with multiple inheritance,
described in more detail <a href="doc/objectclasshelp/objectclass">here.</a>
<li>
<a href="packages/current/prb/teach/rulebase">Poprulebase</a>, an
interpreter for rule based systems, useful for "knowledge-based"
programming (described in more detail
<a href="packages/current/prb/help/poprulebase">here</a>),
<li>
The
<a href="packages/current/rclib/help/rclib">RCLIB</a> package,
using objectclass, to provide a variety of 2-D graphical programming
<a href="figs/rclib/rc_graphic.html">tutorials</a> and tools, and
including
<a href="figs/rclib/graphplot">a library for drawing graphs generated in different
ways.</a>

<li>
The
<a href="packages/current/sim/help/simagent">SimAgent</a> toolkit,
for building scenarios with interacting agents integrated with a 2-D
display.
<li>
<a href="packages/current/popvision/help/popvision">Popvision</a>.
a collection of tutorials and utilities for image analysis and
manipulation, produced by David Young at Sussex University.
<li>
<a href="teach/super_example">The SUPER library,</a> a
'superdatabase' package that provides much of the functionality of
Prolog but smoothly integrated with Pop-11's syntax and pattern
matching facilities.
</ul>
<p>
Most of Poplog is implemented in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP-11">Pop-11</a>, including
the incremental compilers for all four languages and the integrated
programmable editor.
<p>
Because the core language, Pop-11,
makes use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_compilation">incremental
compilation</a>, Pop-11 provides most of the flexibility of an
interpreter and most of the speed of a compiler. (The main
disadvantage is the general difficulty
of porting an incremental compiler to a new platform.)
<p>
Poplog was already a well engineered, robust and highly successful
commercial product in the 1990s, developed jointly by Sussex
University and ISL (Integral Solutions Ltd),
and marketed by ISL, who used it to develop the
widely used <a href="isl-docs/clementine.html">Clementine</a>
data-mining system, until 1998, when ISL was bought by
<a href="http://www.spss.com/uk">SPSS</a> (for Clementine -- later
extended and re-named <a href="http://www.spss.com/software/modeling/modeler/">PASW</a>).
<p>
SPSS were later taken over by IBM, who still seem to have have parts of
Clementine in their Business software:
<br>
<a href="https://www-356.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?&solution=53501">https://www-356.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?&solution=53501</a>
<br>
<a href="https://spss-clementine.software.informer.com/">https://spss-clementine.software.informer.com/</a>
<p>
Poplog Prolog was used to develop the original version of the SPARK toolkit by
Praxis Systems, though they now use Sicstus Prolog, as that has
features not in Poplog Prolog. (There is now a free Open Source
version of the toolset
<a href="http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/spark-gpl-edition/">here.</a>)
<p>
Some information about academic and commercial customers and
products based on Poplog can be found
<a href="isl-docs">here.</a> After the take-over by SPSS, Poplog
became free and open source. Unfortunately, by then academic usage
had dropped, partly because of the high price of Poplog during the
mid 1990s, partly because the full system (including graphics) was
available only on expensive servers and workstations, and only a
subset was available on PCs running Windows. (ISL found that the
costs of sales and supports to academics were not worth the
benefits, so they focused on commercial customers. In those days it
was not possible to sell and support such software via the
internet.)
<p>
The Linux version of poplog, ported in his own time by Julian Clinton
while still working for ISL, did not become available until after
SPSS bought ISL, and this website was started for Free Poplog.
(Initially the port was somewhat incomplete and had a few bugs, but
these were soon identified and fixed. However, changes in Linux and
the C language specification, led to requirements for some further
changes in Linux poplog including
<a href="oldcontents.html#fedoraprob">some problems caused by Selinux</a>.)
<p>
<b>Note added 17 May 2019</b>
<br>
The above paragraph wrongly credited Clark Morton, not Julian Clinton, with the
work on Linux poplog. This has now been corrected.

<a name="size"></a>
<p>
<b>Size (needs to be revised for 64bit Poplog V16)</b>
<br/>
Considering that Poplog includes incremental compilers for four languages
(Pop-11, Prolog, Common Lisp and ML), along with an integrated programmable
editor, and a host of additional libraries and documentation, including teaching
materials, the size of the system is surprisingly small: the complete 32-bit
Linux download package is a little over 17MB (including all system sources,
documentation and libraries, with a number of add-ons). The size was reduced for
<a href="v15.63">Version 15.63</a>, partly by moving the 'contrib' package to
<a href="contrib">a separate location</a> (also
<a href="contrib.zip">in a zip file).</a>
<blockquote>
<small>
(The packaged self-installing <a href="#pcwinversion">windows version of Poplog
V15.5 described
below</a> is even smaller.)
</small>
</blockquote>
The uncompressed Poplog installation directory, after relinking
poplog and building saved
images, requires about 79MB on Linux (since Version 15.63, of
which a large subset can be
removed if not needed). The normal minimum process startup size for
Pop-11 including the editor and incremental compiler, is around
11MB. That can be reduced by using a version linked without some of
the default components, e.g. without indefinite precision
arithmetic, the editor, the X window interface.
<p>
The run-time startup size goes up of course if Prolog, or Lisp, or
ML (or a combination) is included, though not by much because a
great deal is shared between the four compilers.
<p>
<b>Size of Poplog V.16</b>
<br/>
The system installed at Birmingham in January 2020, including all system sources
and the Poplog Packages tree, and various *.o and *.w files in src directories
that could be deleted is around 105MB. Deleting the *.o and *.w files saves
about 8MB.
<p>
<b>Speed</b>
<br/>
Partly because of its compactness Pop-11 and the other Poplog
languages are comparatively fast when running user code,
out-performing interpreted versions of the languages, though not as
fast as batch-compiled languages. (The versatility in supporting
Pop-11, Common Lisp, Prolog and ML adds a small speed penalty
compared with separate dedicated compilers.) The internals of poplog
run very fast because they are implemented in <a href="sysdoc/">a
special dialect of Pop-11</a> with C-like extensions. For example,
code compilation is very fast though this is partly because
the compiler does not do a vast amount of optimisation. Moreover, at
least one researcher at HP Research labs switched from using Lisp on
a dedicated Lisp machine, to using Poplog Lisp on a general purpose
unix workstation, because he found the poplog garbage collector so
much faster. However, machines have speeded up so much since then
that the difference would no longer be so noticeable!

Origins of poplog

<blockquote>
Note: "POPLOG" is a trade mark of the University of Sussex.
<p>
Poplog was developed in the
<a href="http://www.cogs.sussex.ac.uk">
School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences</a>
at the University of Sussex and at
<a href="http://www.isl.co.uk"> ISL</a> (now part of
<a href="http://www.spss.com">SPSS</a>),
and is distributed free of charge by courtesy of both organisations.
Between 1983 and 1998 Poplog was an expensive commercial product,
sold first by Systems Designers Ltd., then ISL, though always with
large discounts for academic users. Examples of commercial and
academic customers, and some of the products produced using Poplog
can be found in this directory

various add-ons supporting teaching and research in AI and Cognitive
Science, developed at Sussex, Birmingham, and elsewhere, including a
package for research and teaching in vision, a powerful and flexible
X window-based GUI package implemented in Pop-11, the SimAgent toolkit
for developing sophisticated agent architectures, and Robin
Popplestone's Scheme in Pop library. There are also
(5) some "easy" to install
complete packages containing the add-ons.

<blockquote>
<p>
Poplog version 15.53 was the first version of poplog to be made
generally available free of charge, including all sources, since about
1982, the year when commercial sales were taken over by Systems
Designers Ltd.
<P>
Some older versions for other platforms
<a href=#versiontable>listed below</a> are also now available free of
charge.
<br/>
(They may be brought up to date later if facilities and resources
become available for rebuilding them.)
<p>
V15.53 (produced in July 1999) included some additions to support
recent versions of Linux, and a few minor bugfixes. Apart from that it
was the same as the commercial version, used world-wide in the
<a href="isl-docs/clementine.html">Clementine data-mining system.
</a>
<P>
Since then Poplog has undergone development and bug-fixes. New
versions have been made available at the Birmingham Poplog site, and
are announced elsewhere in this file. An older version,
<a href="#pcwinversion">Poplog Version 15.5</a> was made available
for use on Windows, but lacking the graphical capabilities available
in poplog on Linux, Unix and VMS systems. The
<a href="#openpoplog">OpenPoplog project at Sourceforge </a> aims
to remove the difference.
<P>
Reduced versions
supporting Pop-11 as a scripting language may become available later,
e.g. at www.poplog.org.
(June 2009: This site is now defunct.)
<p>
As explained below,
<a href="#bugfixes">A directory for bugreports and "bugfixes"</a>
has been set up for corrections to library and documentation files as
well as system sources.
<p>
Coordination of further development work is managed through the
<a href="#faqinfo">comp.lang.pop newsgroup</a> and
the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/comp.lang.pop.faq.html#EMAIL">pop-forum
email list</a>. There is also a more specialised email list (poplog-dev)
for those who wish to be involved in detailed technical discussions of
development work. If you wish to join the poplog-dev email list write to
A.Sloman@cs.bham.ac.uk.
<p>
A (rarely updated!) table summarising available versions of poplog
is available here:

<h3><B>
The free Poplog distribution directory

<blockquote>
When Poplog version 15.53 first became available free and open source
the main location for bundled versions was
the
<a href="new/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/new/</a> directory. The contents are described
<a href="#versiontable">below.</a>
Since then new bundled versions have also become available, not stored
there. Go to the 'new' directory only if there is not another bundle
(e.g. the standard Linux Poplog bundle) that suits your requirements.

<h3><B>System Documentation:</B></h3>
<blockquote>
Detailed instructions for installing Unix and Linux poplog, were originally in
<a href="new/install.txt">install.txt</a>. Most users can now ignore that as
there are special instructions for the packaged versions of linux poplog
described below.
<p>
Instructions for the Windows version of Poplog V15.5 are included in the
windows poplog package (below), and separately available in the file
<a href="new/pcwinpoplog.txt"> new/pcwinpoplog.txt</a>
<br>(Windows poplog
V15.53 is only for experts. For more details see
<a href="#pcwin1553">this section below</a>, or this directory
<a href="winpop/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/winpop/</a>
).
<p>
A <a href="#userguide">User Guide</a> is available, included
with all the current bundled versions of poplog.
<p>
Documentation on rebuilding poplog can be found in
<a href="sysdoc/rebuilding"> sysdoc/rebuilding</a>. Scripts for
installing and re-linking are included with poplog.
<p>
Utilities to help with re-linking or rebuilding will go in the
<a href="tools/"> tools/</a>
subdirectory, including a script which will be useful if you have
difficulties re-linking unix versions of poplog. (Improved version now
included in PC linux poplog since Version 15.6).
<p>
Documentation on Porting poplog can be found in
<a href="sysdoc/ppg"> sysdoc/ppg (Poplog Porting Guide)</a>.
<p>
Most of poplog is implemented in
<a href="sysdoc/syspop11">an extended dialect of pop-11
(SysPop-11),</a>
so porting poplog requires a
running version of poplog to do the cross-compilation.
<P>
<b>Obsolete package installation mechanism.</b>
<br/>
A shell script for installing "local extensions" received as gzipped tar
files was previously available here:
<a href="com/install_package">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/com/install_package</a>
and documented here
<a href="tools/install_package/install_package.txt">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/tools/install_package/install_package.txt</a>
<p>
Since version V15.6 This mechanism is now replaced by <a href="#poppackages">a new package
structure</a> in the Poplog directory tree.

</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
New minor version introduced: v15.6301
<li>
Old procedure that used to attempt to trap syntactic error messages
going to status line in Ved removed.
<li>
Error messages now by default do not go to Ved's status line. You
can change this by making ved_errs_on_status true. (Default is
false).
<li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3><b>
NEWS 4 Jul 2009 (<a href="v15.63/">Version 15.63</a>): Some rationalisation and reduction in system size
</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Moved <a href="#popcontrib">the 'contrib' directory</a> out of the
default package and removed some old redundant files. As a result
the compressed tar file for
32-bit Linux poplog (v15.63) is about 3MB smaller, i.e. about 16MB.
Likewise the expanded poplog system is about 10 MB smaller.
<br/>
The contrib directory is now browsable
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/contrib">here,</a>
and can be downloaded as
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/contrib.tar.gz">a gzipped tar file</a>
or as a zip file <a href="packages/contrib.zip">contrib.zip</a>
(e.g. for use with Windows Poplog).
<li>
All Poplog documentation has been stripped of special Ved/XVed
characters, so that all files can now be read in any editor, and
also in any Web browser.
The stripped documentation is now browsable
<a href="docs">here (about 26 MB)</a>
<br>
A browsable version of the original documentation (immediately
before stripping, i.e. between v15.62 and v15.63) including special
Ved characters can be found
<a href="unstripped-docs">here (about 27MB).</a>
<li>
Anyone wishing to download the documentation on its own for local
viewing can get the version including the special ved characters
(the unstripped documentation -- only of use to Ved users)
<a href="unstripped-docs.tar.gz">in this gzipped tar file
(about 6MB)</a> and the stripped documentation
<a href="docs.tar.gz">in this gzipped tar file (under 6MB)</a>.
<li>
For more detailed descriptions of changes see this
<a href="latest-poplog/">latest-poplog</a> contents.
<li>
Downloading the new version (32bit Linux poplog)
<br/>
    There are two shell scripts provided for conveniently downloading and installing
    poplog v15.63. After fetching the script you want to use, make sure it is executable
    (using 'chmod ugo+x'), then run it
    <ul>
    <li><a href="v15.63/get-and-install-v15.63-poplog">get-and-install-v15.63-poplog</a>
<br/>
    Fetches additional scripts, downloads the tar file, and installs
    in /usr/local/poplog, with links from /usr/local/bin/poplog and
    'man' files in /usr/local/man/man1
    You will probably need to run that script as superuser (root) or
    using 'sudo', since it needs to use 'system' directories.

    <li><a href="v15.63/get-and-install-v15.63-poplog-here">get-and-install-v15.63-poplog-here</a>
<br/>
Fetches additional scripts, downloads the tar file, and installs
    in a directory <i>below</i> the directory in which it is run,
i.e. not /usr/local/poplog. So superuser access is not required.
<br/>
    The 'poplog' and 'poplog.sh' startup scripts are installed in
    a directory below the one used to run the get-and-install
    script, namely in v15.63/pop/v15.63/bin/

Single float external function results work in linux poplog
It was found recently that in Linux Poplog calling external functions
(e.g. C or Fortran) that produced single float results did not work
properly: the wrong results were returned. This problem has now
<a href="bugfixes/BUGREPORTS">been fixed</a>. As a result of this all
the new features of the Popvision library now work, including the large
new
<a href="#lapop">'matlab-like' package.</a>
(The packages also work in Sparc/Solaris poplog, which did not have the
external function problem.)
<li>
<h4><B>
1 Jan 2005:
</B></h4>
Some new problems fixed and change notes updated. Many users have had problems
with function keys not working in linux poplog as packaged for Birmingham users
in the bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz file. The problem has been tracked down to a
mistake in the file
<br>
    $poplocal/local/setup/Poplib/vedinit.p
A revised version can be fetched from
<a href="setup/Poplib/vedinit.p">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/setup/Poplib/vedinit.p</a>
<P>
The pop-11 sockets library does not work on systems where the C library
no longer supports 'errno'. The core of poplog was fixed to deal with
this in July 2003, but a new version of the socket library was not
installed to make use of this fix until today. It can be fetched from
<br>
<a href="bugfixes/pop/lib/lib/unix_sockets.p">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/bugfixes/pop/lib/lib/unix_sockets.p</a>

Installation scripts generalised, and Linux Poplog
re-packaged
The scripts for installing Linux poplog have been modified so
as to cope better with more problems, e.g. gcc missing, or linking
a new binary failed for some reason. In particular, short-cut
installation procedures
<a href="linux-cd/SHORT-CUT-INSTALLATION.txt">described here</a>
should work in more circumstances. (Thanks to Andrew Starling for
reporting in detail problems experienced installing Poplog on SuSe 9.2).
<P>
In addition, the rpms for Ctwm and Openmotif previously included in the
package for the benefit of Birmingham students are no longer included
since both are readily available on the internet and a later version of
Openmotif is included in many Linux distributions. This has reduced the
size of
<a href="#bhamlinuxpoplog">the integrated Birmingham Linux Poplog package</a>
from about 21Mbytes to about 19Mbytes.

External linker bug fixed (Linux PC Poplog)
After a new version of the popvision library (see 7 Dec 2004 news

linker was discovered: it did not treat symbols in external libraries as
global. Thanks to help from David Young and Jeff Best, the source of the

<li>
Linear algebra package

gives a direct interface to the Lapack linear algebra package,
(and BLAS library) which has very wide scope.
<br>
<a href="popvision/help/lapop">LAPOP</a>
gives a simpler, higher-level interface to some common linear
algebra functions, including matrix multiplication, linear equations,
least-squares problems, eigenvalue and singular value decompositions.
<li>
<a href="popvision/help/arrpack">ARRPACK</a>
provides procedures for arithmetic and
logical operations on
arrays, using external procedures for efficiency. (Largely supersedes
the
<a href="popvision/help/float_arrayprocs">FLOAT_ARRAYPROCS</a>
library).
<li>
New Array operations include
<br>
* newintarray creates packed integer arrays.
<br>
* newdfloatarray creates double-precision packed floating-point arrays.
<br>
* newrfloatarray creates packed floating-point arrays with precision
depending on popdprecision.
<br>
* newcfloatarray creates complex single-precision packed floating-point
arrays with alternating real and imaginary parts.
<br>
* newzfloatarray creates complex double-precision packed floating-point
arrays with alternating real and imaginary parts.

<li>
Image structure operations extended, including
<br>
* corners_hs implements the Harris-Stephens corner detector.
<br>
* snakes implements very simple adaptive contours.
<li>
External language interface
<br>
* excall allows external functions to be passed the addresses of
arbitrary elements of vectors.
<P>
NOTE: the popvision library was re-built on 24th December 2004,
following fixing of the external linker bug mentioned above.
If you have installed the latest core linux Poplog version (24 December
2004 or later) with the linker bug mentioned above fixed,
and you obtained popvision before then, you are advised to fetch the
latest
<a href="popvision.tar.gz">version of popvision</a> and install it.
To take full advantage of some parts of it you will need to have
the Lapack and Blas libraries installed, available from

Linux Poplog is provided in gzipped tar file format, for
installation on PC (Intel or AMD). 32-bit Versions of Linux Poplog
have been tested on RedHat Linux 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, 9.0,
RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora core 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and various versions
of Debian, Ubuntu, Slackware, Mandrake, Suse Linux, and freeBSD but
it probably works on several more. However, non-backward compatible
changes in versions of linux sometimes cause problems.
<p>
Some of the downloadable versions are "current" whereas others
are older because we have not had access to machines on which
to update them.

<blockquote>
<B>Graphical extras, and use of Motif/Lesstif</B>
<br>
Poplog has a wide range of 2D graphical facilities that work in
connection with the X window system on linux and unix platforms. These
can be enhanced by the use of Motif though it is not essential for
poplog. Motif provides a collection of additional graphical tools used
by menus and scroll-bars in the poplog X-based editor XVed, though XVed
can be used without menus and scroll-bars.
<P>
However many other Poplog graphical facilities can also work without
motif. The Birmingham graphical toolkit,
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib">RCLIB,</a>
available as an add-on to poplog (described below) does not require
motif, and provides menus, sliders, dials, and other GUI facilities.
Because it is implemented in Pop-11 it is much easier to modify or
extend than motif. It is also used for graphical displays in
the SimAgent toolkit, demonstrated
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/simagent">here.</a>
<P>
If your linux system does not include motif, you should, if you wish, be
able to use poplog with the free Openmotif version, now available from
<a href="http://www.openmotif.org/">http://www.openmotif.org/</a>
and also included in many linux distributions, since several
commercial packages based on linux and unix make use of Motif.
<p>
If that link
fails try giving www.google.com or some other search engine the key
"linux motif", or "openmotif".
<P>
The latest version of Lesstif, distributed with many versions of Linux,
can also be used as an alternative to Motif, though there are some
minor discrepancies.
<P>
Previously, two versions of Poplog for linux+PC were made available, one
linked for use with motif and one linked for use without. Linux Poplog
is now distributed in a new format, as described below, with fewer
pre-compiled binaries, reducing download time. Installation scripts are
provided which configure poplog to run with or without motif, as
required.

PC NT/XP/Windows versions of Poplog:
</B></h3>
This section is probably out of date!
<blockquote>
At present (January 2010) the implementations
of Poplog for Windows do not provide all the facilities of
Linux/Unix poplog.
In particular, they do not provide the Poplog graphical facilities that
work on the X window system on Unix and Linux.
<p>
However it is possible to run Linux poplog within Windows using
VirtualBox, as described <a href="ova">here.</a>
<p>
It is also possible to run linux poplog on Windows by using the free
trial version of VMWARE
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/">http://www.vmware.com/</a>.
For instance the
hybrid-sheepdog demonstration here
<a href="figs/simagent/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/simagent/</a>
was produced by an MSc student using Linux PC poplog, under Vmware on a
laptop running Windows XP.
<p/>
It can also be made to work with the free 'andLinux' package along with
Xming, as described <a href="winpop/andl/">here</a>. (This information may be
out of date. If so please let A.S. know.)
<p>
It is likely that increasing development of 'virtualisation' tools
will make it much easier to run programs developed in one operating
system on another.
<p>
<a href="openpoplog.html">The Open Poplog project</a> aims to
re-engineer poplog in a more platform-independent form eventually.
However, that project seems to have been hit by the financial crash around
2008-2010.
<P>
For those users of Microsoft Windows who do not wish to use andLinux
or VirtualBox or Vmware the following options are available -- but there is no
guarantee that they still work (in 2020).

1. A version of Windows Poplog 15.5 packaged for easy installation
<br>with
a
split-screen version of the Ved editor.
</B></h3>
This is available packaged in three formats:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="new/pcwin15.5.zip"> pcwin15.5.zip (zip archive)</a>

file)</a>
<li>
<a href="new/pcwin-15.5.tar"> pcwin-15.5.tar (tar file)</a>
These are all the same version of Poplog Version 15.5 for Intel PC
running NT or Windows 95/98/2000, packaged slightly differently for
downloading. The source files for Windows Poplog version 15.5 are
available here:
<a href="new/pcwnt-sources.tar.gz">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/new/pcwnt-sources.tar.gz</a>
<P>
This version of Poplog has no graphics, no support for X, and only the
"dumb-terminal" version of the editor VED (allowing split-window use).
It was designed primarily for use with NT, but can work with
Win95/98/2000, and probably later versions of windows (e.g. XP).
<P>
The installation instructions are in the README
file, included in the package, and

<P>
Novices may find the more conveniently packaged version 15.5 windows
poplog (listed above) easier to install and use.
<P>
The V15.53 poplog package for windows includes all the sources and I
believe the "stubs" that were used in the
<a href="http://www.spss.com">Clementine data mining package</a>
to link to an X window emulation running
windows NT. Perhaps a windows expert can use this to add graphics to
windows poplog, or even make XVed work under windows?
<P>
This newer version of windows poplog does not include a
self-installation file providing a desktop shortcut that starts up the
Ved editor. If anyone is able to package it so that it can be used by
novices, like the older version above, please inform A.Sloman AT
cs.bham.ac.uk

<h4><b>
Porting Poplog to Mac+OSX on PPC
</b></h4>

<blockquote>
<b>Poplog on Intel Mac</b>
<br>
(Probably out of date!)
<br>
Although there is a partial port of Poplog for Mac OSX on PPC,
there isn't one for Intel-based Macs. For those, the best way to run
poplog is now to install a version of linux (e.g. some have used
'archlinux because it is small) in a virtual operating system (e.g.
using VMWare) and then to install and run the latest Linux poplog.
<p>
<b>Poplog on OSX</b>
<br>
As a first step towards the OSX port, Poplog was ported to Darwin
on PC. Testers and helpers are invited to look at the files here
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/darwin+pc/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/darwin+pc/</a>
<P>
Later a nearly working system for OSX was provided, which is accessible
in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/osx/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/osx/</a>
<br>
It was tested by a non-Mac user here and found to work, but the X window
graphical facilities do not yet work. Perhaps this has something to do
with dynamic libraries, and can be fixed by an OSX expert.
<p>
Everything else seems to work. However the facilities for
automatically rebuilding poplog have not been updated to run on OSX yet.
<p>
An alternative is for an OSX user with X11 installed to run Poplog
remotely on a linux or solaris machine running Poplog. For further
information see
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/osx/AREADME.txt"> this
file.</a>

</blockquote>
<li>
Poplog has also been ported to Linux on AMD 64-bit PC, but the old
port has been replaced by the new 64-bit Poplog available here:

<h3><B>
VED-LIKE INTERFACE FOR EMACS USERS
</B></h3>
<blockquote>
The Poplog system was built around the integrated editor Ved
(implemented in Pop-11), which includes facilities for rapidly accessing
help files, teaching documentation and library sources
through "hypertext links", and for transferring commands to the
incremental compiler(s) and reading output from the compilers into an
editor buffer. This makes learning, development and testing very easy,
especially for novice programmers.
<P>
A number of Emacs users have developed a package that supports similar
use of Pop-11 and other Poplog languages from Emacs, and includes
utilities for reading the Ved "graphics enhanced" documentation files.
The package can be downloaded here:
<a href="emacs.tar.gz">emacs.tar.gz</a>
or browsed online here
<a href="emacs/">
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/emacs/</a>
<br>
This is already included in the larger "complete" packages.

<h3><b>
THE POPLOG PACKAGE STRUCTURE INTRODUCED IN VERSION 15.6 (2005)
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
Around January 2005 Poplog was reorganised. A sub-directory was
introduced $usepop/pop/packages (with environment variable
$poppackages to allow for its location to be changed).
<br>
Many of the extensions that had been available as special packages
from Birmingham University, Sussex University, or elsewhere that had
previously been separately down-loadable packages were moved into
that directory, and some of the AI tutorial material that had been
part of the core Pop-11 code and documentation libraries was moved
into
<a href="packages/current/teaching/">a 'teaching' package.</a>
<p>
Each package has a top level directory containing a
pop-11 program to extend the poplog search lists (popautolist,
popuseslist, vedhelplist, vedteachlist, etc.) and subdirectories
such as auto/, lib/, teach/, help/, ref/, data/ and others, if
needed.
<p>
Some parts of poplog that were deemed not to be suitable for
inclusion in the core of the system, e.g. items concerned with
teaching AI rather than teaching programming in Pop-11 or Prolog,
etc. were moved into the 'teaching' package.
<blockquote>
<small>
<b>NOTE:</b> This process is not yet complete. The reorganisation
will be continued, depending on available time.

The SimAgent is a very general and flexible toolkit for exploring agent

powerful forward chaining production system interpreter, Poprulebase,
described <a href="prb/help/poprulebase">here,</a> which
supports integration of symbolic and subsymbolic
mechanisms (e.g. neural
nets). Multiple concurrent instantiations of Poprulebase define a
processing architecture for an agent. The SimAgent toolkit supports
development of systems in which multiple such agents can co-exist and
interact. SimAgent was described in the March 1999 issue of
<a href="http://www.acm.org/cacm/">Communications</a>
of the
<a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM.</a>

The Array manipulation and Linear Algebra Packages in Popvision
</B></h3>
<blockquote>
The Popvision package includes three new libraries (added in 2004) that
make available a very rich collection of array manipulation facilities
and mathematical facilities including the BLAS and LAPACK linear algebra
packages, all now accessible interactively from pop-11.

<ul>
<li>
<h3><B>
<a href="popvision/help/arrpack">The ARRPACK package</a>
</B></h3>
This provides an array processing package for Pop-11. It includes
efficient procedures (implemented in C) to
carry out arithmetic and logical operations
    on elements of real and complex arrays. A whole array or a subset of
    its elements may be processed in a single procedure call. ARRPACK is
    restricted to operations in which each array element is treated
    separately from other elements of the same array, such as the
    element-by-element addition of two arrays. (Operations where each
    element is processed along with its neighbours, such as convolution,
    Fourier transforms and matrix operations, are provided by other
    libraries.) A higher-level interface to these procedures may be
    provided in future.

<li>
<h3><B>
The LAPACK and LAPOP libraries
</B></h3>
These libraries provide Pop11 interfaces to BLAS and LAPACK

<ul>
<li>
<B>
    <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html">http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html</a>
</B>
<br>
    The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are high quality
    "building block" routines for performing basic vector and matrix
    operations. Level 1 BLAS do vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS
    do matrix-vector operations, and Level 3 BLAS do matrix-matrix
    operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely
    available, they're commonly used in the development of high quality
    linear algebra software, LINPACK and LAPACK for example.

<P>
<li>
<B>
    <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">http://www.netlib.org/lapack/</a>
</B>
<br>
    LAPACK is written in Fortran77 and provides routines for solving
    systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of
    linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
    problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD,
    Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related computations
    such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition
    numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general sparse
    matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided for real and
    complex matrices, in both single and double precision.

    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/eliza/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/eliza/</a>
<br>
Between September 2002 and February 2005 this on-line Pop-11 Eliza
had answered about 17,100 questions. It is just a toy, but is less
repetitive than many of the
online versions of Eliza (partly because of the variety of rules and
partly because of the way rules are randomised on each cycle) and it has
been of considerable educational value in introductory AI courses.
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/lib/elizaprog.p">A
slightly simpler version of the
code for
the Pop-11 eliza</a>
is available for use with poplog.
<p>
A slightly revised version is used for the Poplog Eliza web site,
available here:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/lib/eliza2.p">here</a>).
<p>
NOTE: since the speak_espeak program was added to Pop-11, you can
make Eliza speak as well as type responses to the user, provided you
have the linux espeak package installed. Use google to find it for
your system. On Fedora 10 it was installed simply by using the
command:
<pre>
    yum install espeak</pre>

A teach file introducing students to the task of building their own
version of Eliza in Pop-11 can be found here
<a href="doc/popteach/respond">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/doc/popteach/respond</a>
<P>
A different design, produced by Riccardo Poli, for a potentially much
more sophisticated Eliza, because it can maintain and manipulate
arbitrary memories of its interactions in the Poprulebase database, can
be found in the middle of this introduction to Poprulebase

<h3><B>
SOME ADDITIONAL BROWSABLE DIRECTORIES
</B></h3>
<P>
The Pop-11 and AI teaching and documentation files previously included
in the
<a href="oldcontents.html#bhamteach">bhamteach tar package</a> and now
part of the
standard Poplog distribution,
can be browsed online in these directories:
<ul>
<li><a href="teach/">teach/</a> (Teach files)
<li><a href="help/">help/</a> (Help files)
<li><a href="auto/">auto/</a> (Autoloadable libraries)
<li><a href="lib/">lib/</a> (Non-autoloadable libraries)
</ul>
Not all the files in those directories are included in the "bhamteach"
package. Not all of them are concerned with Poplog and Pop-11. E.g.
some are introductions to Unix facilities, such as
<a href="teach/Unix.intro">teach/Unix.intro</a>.
<P>
There are other online browsable files included in various packages
some of which, though not all, are mentioned
elsewhere in this file. E.g.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="doc/">The
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/doc/ directory</a>
<br>
This contains copies of documentation directories in poplog, since
version v15.63.
<li><a href="rclib/">rclib/</a> the RCLIB teach, help, auto
and lib files, illustrated here
<li> <a href="rcmenu/">rcmenu</a> the RCMENU extension to RCLIB,
which makes possible the autoloadable "menu" definitions in this
directory
<a href="rcmenu/menus/">rcmenu/menus/</a>.
<li> <a href="newkit/prb/">newkit/prb/</a> the Poprulebase
teach, help, auto and lib files.
<li> <a href="newkit/sim/">newkit/sim/</a> the SimAgent
teach, help, auto and lib files.
<li> <a href="popvision/">popvision/</a> the Popvision libraries
(from David Young at Sussex University)
<li> <a href="neural/">neural/</a> some neural net facilities (includes
C programs linked to pop-11)
<li> <a href="string_ops/">string_ops/</a> String manipulation utilities
provided by Steve Leach.
<li> <a href="ved_latex/">ved_latex/</a> Latex tutorial and some
utilities for producing and previewing latex files in Ved.
<li> <a href="xml-dist/">xml-dist/</a> Package by Steve Leach which
he says "..allows you to seamlessly interleave Pop11 and XML.
The combination is really quite powerful.  Using it I am able to
get results in a few minutes where people using Perl/CPAN are
taking weeks". The whole package is also downloadable in
a gzipped tar file <a href="xml-dist.tar.gz">xml-dist.tar.gz</a>
</ul>

<h3><B>
ADDITIONAL UTILITIES (E.G. PATTERNS, NEWS, LATEX, EMAIL)
<br>
<small>
NB: These are already included in
<a href="#pclinuxpoplog">the latest Poplog package for linux on PC.</a>
</small>
</B></h3>
<blockquote>
Several additional "packages" are available, mostly developed in the
University of Birmingham. All these are compressed tar files,
or simply tar files.
These should be
unpacked in the <B>$poplocal/local/</B>
directory in order to be conveniently
accessible. You can put them in a different place if you understand how
to manipulate the search lists used by Ved and the Poplog compilers.
<p>
<b>
Do not install them if you have Poplog version 15.6,
15.62, or later, as they are already included.
