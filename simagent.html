<h3><b>
INTRODUCTION
</b></h3>
The SimAgent toolkit (originally called SIM_AGENT) provides a range of
resources for research and teaching related to the development of
interacting agents in environments of various degrees and kinds of
complexity. It can be run as a pure simulation tool, or installed in a
robot with a sufficiently powerful on-board computer, e.g. running
linux. It was originally developed to support exploratory research on
human-like intelligent agents, but has also been used for student
projects developing a variety of interactive games and simulations.
<p>
Unlike many so-called 'agent toolkits', like PRS/Jack, Mozart, Alice,
and several more, that are aimed mainly at development of systems
involving large numbers of highly distributed fairly homogeneous
relatively 'small' agents, SimAgent can be used for such purposes (and
was used in that way for a while by Matthias Scheutz at Notre Dame
University) but (like ACT-R, COGENT, and the original SOAR) SimAgent is
primarily designed to support design and implementation of very complex
agents, each composed of very different interacting components (like a
human mind) where the whole thing is embedded in an environment that
could be a mixture of physical objects and other agents of many sorts,
as half-jokingly depicted here:
<p>

<center>
<img alt="arch1" border="1" width="300"
src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/arch1.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>

For example the main motivation behind the development of SimAgent was
originally to support research on an increasingly complex sequence of agent
types, that led to the development of the biologically inspired CogAff
architecture Schema depicted in the images below, showing layers of
sophistication superimposed on different types of functionality represented by
the columns:
<p>
<a name="cogaff-schema-blank"></a>
<h3><b>
The CogAff schema
</b></h3>
<center>
<img alt="cogaff" border="1" width="300"
src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/gridblank.jpg"/>
<p>
<i>The CogAff Architecture Schema</i>
<br>
</center>

<p>
That schema accommodates a wide variety of specific architecture types,
which differ according to which mechanisms and information structures
occur in which boxes, and how they are connected to one another and to
the environment, as described in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/#overview">this
overview.</a>
<p>
The simplest architectures (e.g. microbe-like or insect-like agents) use
only the bottom (purely reactive) layer of the CogAff schema, whereas
more sophisticated architectures use all the layers (the top ones are
the ones that evolved latest).
<p>
The above diagram is misleading in various ways because it suggest that the
perception mechanisms and action mechanisms are separate from each other and can
only communicate via the 'central' mechanisms, whereas it is clear (as James
Gibson pointed out in his 1966 book <i>The Senses Considered as Perceptual
Systems</i>) action and perception are deeply integrated, e.g. the constant use
of saccades, changes of vergence, changes of focus in vision, and the need to
move your hand when it is used to perceive shape, texture, weight, flexibility,
hardness, etc. of objects.
<p>
So a more accurate, but less clear depiction of the ideas in the CogAff
architecture schema is the following (with thanks to Dean Petters, for help with
this diagram, indicating that action and perception mechanisms overlap, as
pointed out by J.J.Gibson in 1966(Referenced above).

<br>
information-processing mechanisms to straddle two or more layers.

<p>
The above diagrams are not intended to present a specific architecture, but a
space of types of components of an architecture leaving open many different
routes in which the components can communicate, some of which may grow during
development and learning.

<a name="h-cogaff"></a>
<h3><b>
The H-Cogaff Conjecture
</b></h3>
A special case is the conjectured human-like H-CogAff architecture depicted in a
sketchy manner below, with components described in more detail in the
overview and in papers and presentations on the CogAff web site:
<p>
<center>
<img alt="h-cogaff" border="1" width="450"
src="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/fig/hcogaff.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>

<p>
So far nothing as complex as that has been implemented, though various
fragments have been, by collaborators, research fellows and PhD students.
<p>
Some of our undergraduates and MSc students have
also used various parts of the toolkit, e.g. the 'Popracer' undergraduate
project:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/popracer/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/popracer/</a>
<p>
There are some overlaps between these ideas and the architectural ideas in
Marvin Minsky's 2006 book <i>The Emotion Machine</i>. The main difference is
that he was proposing a theory about the information-processing architecture of
a typical human whereas our CogAff project was attempting to uderstand a space
of possible information-processing architectures that might be found in various
kinds of organism. He was also interested in non-human information processing
and was aware that many of his ideas were relevant to other intelligent animals.
But I don't think he was interested in the sort of generative approach to
information-processing architectures adopted in the CogAff project, and our work
on interactions between trajectories in design space and trajectories in niche
space (the space of sets of requirements).

<h3><b>
The SimAgent toolkit
</b></h3>
The toolkit was developed between 1993 and around 2004 (with occasiontal
bug-fixing or enhancements since then) for use by students, post-doctoral
researchers, other colleagues and external collaborators to explore various
aspects of the space of possible sets of requirements for intelligent agents
(Niche Space) and the space of possible designs for meeting those requirements
(Design Space).

<p>
The toolkit is available as part of Poplog in the FreePoplog
directory
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html
</a>
<br/>
The most widely used version is for 32-bit Linux (though there is also a
64 bit version).
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog</a>
<br/>
(includes download instructions).
<p>
Also available for non-linux users (e.g. MSWindows, or Mac) in a Virtual
Box Package
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/ova">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/ova</a>
<p>
Because of its implementation using Pop11 in Poplog it is relatively
light weight, and teaching demos and student projects have been run on
linux machines with only 64MB RAM. Of course, the amount of memory
required at run time depends on what is built with it.
<p>
The download
package is under 20MB and when installed occupies a directory of less
than 90MB -- the exact size depending on the number and type of saved
images created. (The defaults include images for running Prolog, Common
Lisp, and Standard ML.)
<p>
The total size can be much smaller, if unwanted languages in Poplog, the
system sources, and documentation are removed, e.g. for running on a
small robot.
<p>
External libraries, e.g. for vision, or for speech generation (e.g.
using 'espeak' on linux) can add to the size required.
</blockquote>
<br>
Like everything else in Poplog, SimAgent is free of charge
with open source, including tutorial examples and documentation. It
runs in the Poplog multi-language environment, on a variety of unix
and linux systems. A version without graphics will work on Windows
PCs. The full system can run on Windows using VirtualBox.
<p>
The <a href="../openpoplog.html">OpenPoplog project</a> aims to port the
full functionality to Windows+PC. However, with the use of
virtualisation, e.g. using the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VmWare
environment</a> or <a
href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMFusion</a> or
VirtualBox, full Linux Poplog, including SimAgent with graphics, can run
under both Windows and Apple OSX (on Intel-based Macs), as illustrated
here:

who made significant suggestions for improvements during
the early stages. Some of the ideas were inspired by Jonathan

Although SimAgent was originally developed to simulate multiple agents
and/or individual agents with multiple concurrently active interacting
sub-mechanisms, it was mainly used on a single CPU (although some users
haVE distributed processes communicating via sockets). More recently
there have been two developments supporting distributed versions of
SimAgent

and Georgios Theodoropoulos and Ton Oguara (University of Birmingham),
was voted 8th best out of 78 at

(now at Tufts University) and students allowed SimAgent to be distributed over
different computers and interfaced with other packages.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="objectives"></a>
<h3><b>OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</b></h3>
For our work exploring architectural design requirements for intelligent
human-like agents, and other kinds, we need a facility for rapidly
implementing and testing out different agent architectures, including
scenarios where each agent is composed of several different sorts of
concurrent interacting sub-systems, in an environment where there are
other agents and objects. Some agents should have sensors and effectors,
and some should be allowed to communicate with others. Some agents
should have hybrid architectures including, for example, symbolic
mechanisms communicating with neural nets. We also wanted to be able to
use the toolkit for exploring evolutionary processes, as in the "Blind
and Lazy" scenario mentioned below.
<p>
It was important for us that the toolkit did not embody a commitment
to a particular type of agent architecture, since the whole point was to
support exploration of a variety of architectures.
<p>
We also required a development environment supporting rapid prototyping
(to help with clarifying ill-defined problems), incremental compilation,
changes to code without having to restart a process, support for a wide
variety of AI techniques and programming styles, and tools for graphical
tracing via
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/simagent">displays of a running simulation,</a>
and graphical interaction
via a mouse -- sometimes described as "direct manipulation".
<p>
We wanted it to be easy to do fairly simple things, while also
supporting more complex and difficult programming tasks.
<p>
As a result of analysing requirements implicit in some of our
theoretical work (described in papers in the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">
"Cogaff" project directory</a>, and in some of our
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/talks/">conference and seminar presentations</a>)
a set of ideas for a toolkit emerged.
The first draft was made available in October 1994, and a paper about it
presented at ATAL95. Since then there have been several extensions. Some
of these arose from suggestions made by Jeremy Baxter and Richard
Hepplewhite who were using the toolkit for their work on simulated army
agents at DERA Malvern. Their work is briefly summarised in a panel
alongside a paper on Sim_agent, in <I>Communications of the ACM,</I>
March 1999.
<p>

<a name="paradigms"></a>
<h3><b>
PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS USED IN SIM_AGENT
</b></h3>
It was found useful to combine a variety of programming paradigms
and mechanisms within the toolkit. This is why
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/primer/START.html">Pop-11</a>
in the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html">Poplog</a>
multi-language environment was chosen as
the core implementation language.
<p>
Pop-11 is a multi-paradigm, extendable, incrementally compiled language,
very similar in power and diversity to Common Lisp, but with a more
conventional syntax and some other differences. E.g. it has no
interpreter, only an incremental compiler.
<p>
Here are some of the programming paradigms we felt were necessary for
our architectural explorations:

<ul>
<li> Object oriented programming
        (including generic functions and multiple inheritance)
<br>
Based on the ObjectClass extension to Pop-11 (similar to CLOS).
<p>

<li> Rule-based programming and pattern matching
<br>
Based on the Pop-11
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/doc/pophelp/matches">pattern matcher</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/prb/help/poprulebase">Poprulebase library</a>
<p>

<li> Concurrent processes (threads)
<br>
Based on a rule interpreter that runs for a given number of "cycles"
then suspends itself.
<p>

<li> List processing
(as provided in Pop-11 -- similar to Common Lisp lists),
<p>

<li> Event driven programming (e.g. handling mouse events, or new
percepts)
<br>
Based on the rich interface between Pop-11 and the X window system, e.g.
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/doc/popref/x">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/doc/popref/x</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/doc/popxref/xtoolkit">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/doc/popxref/xtoolkit</a>
<p>

<li> Conventional procedural and functional programming
(provided in Pop-11)
<p>

<li> Reflection and meta-management,
allowing programs to have easy
access to their own rules and to monitor and alter their own internal
processing.
<br>
In particular, an agent's mental mechanisms may use rules that are
in one of the agent's databases on which rules operate. This was
used by
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~cmk">Catriona Kennedy</a> in
her work
on architectures for collaborative intrusion-detection agents.
<p>
Allowing rules that operate on internal databases within agents to
be <I>contained in</I> those databases also makes it easier to design
agents that develop new capabilities, or agents which can be
dynamically extended via new "plug-ins").
<p>

<li> Other computational paradigms needed for particular applications,
<br>
e.g.
    neural nets, logic programming
<br>
(Using the ability of Poprulebase conditions or actions to invoke
arbitrary mechanisms, and the fact that Poplog supports an
implementation of Prolog.)
<p>

<li> Extendable syntax and semantics (macros and beyond)
<br>
Using Pop-11's powerful syntactic extension facilities, possible because
the compiler sub-routines are all available at run time.
<p>

<li> Incremental compilation with dynamic replacement of modules
<br>
(essential for rapid prototyping and interactive testing and debugging).
<p>

<li> Automatic store management and garbage collection.
(particularly fast in Pop-11).
</ul>
<p>

The use of the language Pop-11 makes it far easier to combine all these
paradigms than if we had used any other language, apart from Common
Lisp.
<p>
The current version of the toolkit is very general and flexible, though
perhaps not as easy to use as a toolkit dedicated to a particular type
of architecture.
<p>
For applications requiring a graphical interface, e.g. displaying moving
simulated agents, or with
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib">buttons, sliders, menus,
control-panels,</a> etc.
the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rclib/help/rclib">RCLIB</a>
package is available. There is a library which links RCLIB to Sim_agent,
called
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/sim/help/sim_picagent">SIM_PICAGENT</a>.
<p>
(Note: RCLIB is an object-oriented extension of the old RC_GRAPHIC
package providing 'Relative Coordinate' Graphical facilities. All
drawing is relative to a changeable coordinate frame, allowing
scale-changes, zooming in and out, moving windows into a simulation,
etc.)
<p>
By default sim_agent runs as a single process within which
multiple "threads" manage different objects and agents and also
different components within the "minds" of individual agents. It can
also be used in distributed mode,
using the Pop-11 socket mechanism to
support communication between instances of sim_agent.

<p>

<h3><b>
Pop-11 and Poplog
</b></h3>
The toolkit uses the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/primer/START.html">
Pop-11 language</a>
in the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html">
Poplog software development
</a>
environment. Pop-11, like Common Lisp, is a powerful extendable
multi-purpose programming language supporting multiple paradigms. Within
the Poplog environment Pop-11 also supports programs written in Prolog,
Common Lisp or Standard ML.
<p>
Poplog and Pop-11 previously formed part of an expensive commercial
product, but they are now available,
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html"> free of
charge</a>,
with full sources, courtesy of the Sussex University.
Sim_agent is available at the same site.

This gives an overview of the changes introduced in July 1999 to allow
greater self-reference (reflective capabilities) in agents. I.e. they
can now more easily monitor and change their own processing
architecture.
<p>
The news files report extensions and bug-fixes.
<p>
E.g. extensions in July 1999 made it easier to use the toolkit to create
agents which can observe and alter their own processing architecture.
These changes are described in the NEWKIT document listed below.
<p>
More recent extensions proposed partly by
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sra">Steve Allen</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~cmk">Catriona Kennedy</a>
allowed rules more easily to access databases of other agents,
and extended the facilities for self-monitoring. See the NEWS files
listed below.

<h3><b>Tutorial file</b></h3>

A tutorial introduction to the SIM_AGENT toolkit is provided in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/sim/teach/sim_feelings">
the SIM_FEELINGS teach file,</a>
which is part of the online documentation included in the package.
This file is an executable tutorial demonstration of the use of the
toolkit in a simple scenario involving (very shallow) "emotional"
agents with a simple architecture, moving around in a 2-D world
containing other immobile objects.

<p>
It is a plain text file, designed for viewing in the Poplog
editor VED. It includes code that can be copied and run, if you have a
Poplog system and have fetched the toolkit from the Birmingham Poplog
ftp site.
<p>
A different tutorial, the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/sim/teach/sim_demo">
the TEACH SIM_DEMO
</a>
code produced some of the demonstration "movies", described below.

<p>
<a name="components"></a>
<h3><b>
THE SIM_AGENT TOOLKIT HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS
</b></h3>
The components are the rule interpreter, the sim_agent library and the
rclib graphical package. The first and third can be used independently
of sim_agent.

<p>
<b>
<a name="poprulebase"></a>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/prb/help/poprulebase">
1. Poprulebase:
</a>
</b>
<br>
a very general, flexible and extendable interpreter for condition-action
rules, written in Pop-11. It is based on the idea of a forward-chaining
production system interpreter, but provides a collection of unusual
facilities, including a smooth interface to neural net or other
"sub-symbolic" mechanisms, through so-called "filter" conditions, a
wide variety of condition types and action types (both user-extendable),
and a variety of control options and higher level structuring
facilities.
<p>

Poprulebase allows rulesets to be combined into rulefamilies. Within a
rulefamily, control can be transferred between rulesystems as the
context changes. This also allows SOAR-like pushing and popping of
contexts, as well as other sorts of transitions. Rulefamilies can be
combined into rulesystems. Each agent has a rulesystem, which may be an
arbitrarily complex collection of interacting rulesets and rulefamilies,
with associated databases providing memory stores and communication
channels.

<p>

<b>
<a name="library"></a>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/sim/help/sim_agent">
2. The Sim_agent library
</a>
</b>
<br>

provides a set of base classes and scheduling mechanisms for
running simulations involving a number of objects and agents whose
internal mechanisms are implemented as multiple rulesets or
rulefamilies, using Poprulebase. Sim_agent also makes use of the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/teach/oop">object
oriented
</a>
facilities provided in the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/teach/objectclass_example">
Pop-11 Objectclass package,
</a>
a CLOS-like extension to Pop-11 providing multiple-inheritance, generic
functions, etc. Objectclass, which was designed and implemented by Steve
Knight at HP Research Labs, Bristol, turns Pop-11 into a powerful
language for designing re-usable extendable software modules, as CLOS
does for Lisp.
<p>

In sim_agent, each agent has its own rulesystem which may consist of a
collection of rulesets and rulefamilies implementing a variety of
mechanisms (perception, memory, motive generation, planning,
self-monitoring, etc.). A feature of the toolkit is provision for
differing resource allocation between components of an agent, and
between agents. E.g. some agents may plan quickly relative to their
perceptual processes, others slowly.

<p>
<a name="rclib"></a>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rclib/help/rclib">
3. The RCLIB package:
</a>
This extends the Pop-11 RC_GRAPHIC facility and provides flexible new
tools for building graphical demonstrations and complex
graphical control panels.
<p>
    Examples of displays produced by the "RCLIB" Graphic Library can be
    found in
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib/</a>

can be found here (with

<p>

<a name="running"></a>
<h3><b>RUNNING THE TOOLKIT</b></h3>

The packages can be run only in a Poplog Pop-11 environment, though
anyone who has Poplog may freely copy and use the code (but please let
me know if you do). It requires Poplog Version 15.0 or later.

<h3><b>
CODE AND DOCUMENTATION
</b></h3>
In order to run SimAgent you need to have poplog, various extensions to
Poplog produced in Birmingham (e.g. extending the Pop11 pattern
matcher), the Poprulebase package and the SimAgent package. Use of the
graphical features of SimAgent and the ability to run the graphical
demos also requires the RCLIB package. The simplest way to get
everything if you are using a PC running linux is to download the
whole Birmingham Linux poplog tar file mentioned above and described in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html#pclinuxversions">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html#pclinuxversions</a>
The toolkit is now included in the linux poplog package by default, in the
$usepop/pop/packages/newkit library.
<p>
The following sub-packages are available for download separately.
<p>
<a name="poprulebase"></a>
<b> 1. Poprulebase </b>
<br>

<h3><b>
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
</b></h3>

The bulk of the design and implementation was done by Aaron Sloman who
is also responsible for any major design flaws. However, many
individuals contributed ideas, code, demonstrations, etc., including Luc
Beaudoin and Tim Read who suffered from the lack of something like this
when they were doing their PhDs and (roughly in chronological order)
Riccardo Poli, Jeremy Baxter, Richard Hepplewhite, Darryl Davis, Ian
Wright, Brian Logan, Peter Waudby, Tom Carter, Catriona Kennedy, and
other users at the University of Birmingham, where it is
used for undergraduate and MSc student projects as well as for research.
<p>
The Pop-11 Objectclass system was crucial for the development of both
RCLIB and the SIM_AGENT mechanisms. Objectclass provides multiple
inheritance and generic functions, extending Pop-11 roughly as CLOS
extends Common Lisp. It was originally designed and implemented
by Steve Leach when he was at Hewlett Packard research labs. He is
now a freelance software engineer.
He made many other contributions to the design as a user,
while at Hewlett Packard, some of which are part of poplog, others in libraries
at the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/">Poplog web site.</a>
<p>
Objectclass makes it easy to introduce new types of agents sharing
some default methods with the top level agent class while providing
their own extensions. This was also a requirement for the graphical
tools. Objectclass also made it easy to combine agent classes with
graphical object classes to produce agents which both act in a
simulated world and also display their activity in a 2-D
graphical display, where they can be manipulated with the mouse.
<p>
Code and documentation for objectclass are part of the Poplog
system.
