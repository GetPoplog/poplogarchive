Installing and Testing Poplog on Linux

The programs demonstrated in these videos all use parts of the
Poplog system. In particular I have created several demonstrations
using Pop11, the core language of the poplog system, and the editor
Ved/XVed which is implemented in Pop11. This tutorial shows how to
install 32-bit linux poplog version 15.65 (the latest version,
assembled in December 2011) on a linux system.
<p>
The demonstration uses Fedora version 15, but the same procedure
will work on other versions of linux including for example Ubuntu
and Arch linux. There are slight differences in the preparation
needed for different versions of linux, as pointed out in the video,
and also in the installation instructions here:
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.65/#installing">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.65/#installing</a>.
<p>
<b>N.B.</b>
Since the video was made, two simplified installation scripts have been
provided, one for users of linux based on 'rpm' packages (e.g. Fedora,
Redhat, Scientific Linux, CentOS) and one for users of linux based on
'deb' packages (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, and some others). Those scripts
simplify the installation, as just one script has to be downloaded, made
executable and run. The methods shown in the video will work on other
versions of linux.
<br/>
Script for Ubuntu and other systems using 'apt-get install':
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.65/#ubuntu">Fetch and install 32-bit Poplog on Ubuntu</a>
<br/>
Script for Fedora and other systems using 'yum install':
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.65/#fedora">Fetch and install 32-bit Poplog on Fedora</a>
</a>
<p>

The installation process requires some preparation of the linux
system to ensure that it has the graphical libraries and also the
usual compiling and linking tools (gcc). A shell script can be
downloaded that will check whether you have the required graphical
libraries.
<p>
Then, to do the actual installation,
a short shell script
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.65/get-and-install-v15.65-poplog">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.65/get-and-install-v15.65-poplog</a>
can be downloaded, and made executable and then run. This is all done
automatically in the new scripts for rpm and deb package users mentioned
above.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>
In the video all the installation commands are given without using
the 'sudo COMMAND' format normally required when altering protected
files or directories. That is because I had previously given myself
full read- and write-access to everything in the /usr/local
directory, using this command as super-user:
<pre>
    chown -R XXX /usr/local
</pre>
replacing XXX with my login name on the machine. If you don't want to do
that, you can either prefix all the installation commands with 'sudo',
or first become super-user, e.g. 'sudo su'. Then all installed files
will be owned by the super-user and only super-user can change them.
(There are useful online tutorials on linux/unix giving more
information, e.g.
<a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php">http://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php</a>)

<p>
When the 'get-and-install-v15.65-poplog' script is run, it fetches
a compressed 'tar' file (size about 16.5MB), as shown in the
video, and also fetches another shell script to install the contents
of the tar file. The video shows what the installation process looks
like, and how fast it goes (especially when using a 30Mb/sec cable
broadband connection to do the download). On a slower internet link,
and a slower PC than the one I used the process would take longer,
but on  modern machines it should be at most a minute or two. It
unpacks the tar file into a new directory at the default location
/usr/local/poplog (though you can change that) and after re-linking
the core of poplog, and building saved images to run Pop11, the
editor, Common Lisp, Prolog, and Standard ML it ends up using less
than 80MB for the whole installation.
<p>
Quite a lot of that can be deleted if you don't want all the four
languages and if you don't want to be able to look at the system
source code.
<p>
The tutorial then shows how some demonstrations that are scripted in
the directory
/usr/local/poplog/current-poplog/bin/demos
can be run
to test the installation. In the video, I demonstrate the Pop-11
eliza chatbot, with and without audio output, then a toy simulation
of some simple 'emotional' agents (not really emotional) moving
around and reacting to what happens to them. I also show how some of
David Young's popvision system can be run to do image processing
using tutorials supplied in the popvision library
whose files are also available for browsing here:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/popvision/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/popvision/</a>
<p>
The tutorial ends by showing how, in addition to the saved images
created to support the different poplog languages a shell script
provided can be used to create another little demonstration of a
very simple interactive simulated conversational robot inspired by
the work of Terry Winograd on his SHRDLU system around 1971. The
pop11 version is simpler than Shrdlu mainly because its natural
language capabilities are very much simpler, but also because the
world it talks about is simpler.)
<p>
All the demos shown (and many more) are implemented using programs
that students or teachers can copy and edit in order to produce new
versions with different capabilities. Some of them can be used by
novices (e.g. starting with a very simple chatbot) whereas others
will stretch advanced students, e.g. the Shrdlu example.
With a development environment like Poplog it is possible for the
teacher to isolate a small
part of a complex package and invite students to modify or extend
that small part, while using the rest as a 'black box', defining an
experimental 'microworld', as a rewarding and challenging learning
experience. (For an example see the
<a href="#riverworld">riverworld tutorial</a> below.)
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>
Supplying poplog using a tar file and an install script, rather than
a typical linux package (e.g. deb or rpm), gives the user a lot of
choice as to where and how it will be installed, compared with
installation using a standard linux package in Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
It also allows the same system to be installed in two (or more)
different places, so that one is for regular use while experimenting
with modifying or extending another version.

This is a sequel to my previous tutorial (pop-espeak2.ogv)
<p>
This is part of a planned series of video tutorials introducing some of the features of Pop-11, an AI programming language (part of the Poplog system).
<p>
Unlike the previous tutorials this one makes use of Poprulebase, an extension to Pop11 designed for construction of rule-based systems and used in the SimAgent toolkit.
<p>
This tutorial does not claim to show how to model what goes on in the mind of a child learning about numbers but does aim to show how one's scientific understanding of the nature of the process can be enhanced by trying to build models of various aspects of the competences. This could help to guide both experimental and modelling research investigating how the learning and development processes occur in children. It could also be a precursor to the design of future robots with human-like intelligence (still a very long way to go).
The tutorial uses some of the ideas in Chapter 8 of "The Computer Revolution in Philosophy"
(1978).
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/chap8.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/chap8.html</a>
<br/>
"On learning about numbers: Problems and Speculations"
The chapter (like <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/crp/">the whole book</a>)
is on-line.
<p>

I also believe that using computers to model some of the processes
by which animals reason and human children acquire and extend their
mathematical knowledge and competence is relevant to Philosophy of
mathematics as illustrated in these talks:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/talks/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/talks/</a>

<p>
The demo uses a text file including comments and code, end ends with some suggestions for project work extending the demo in various ways. The text file is available online here:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/number-rulebase.txt">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/number-rulebase.txt</a>

<p>
Since this video was made several of the rules in that file have had comments added to the code.
<p>
The video was unscripted and there are at least two mistakes in portions of the presentation relating the program's demonstrated behaviour to the code. One mistake was to use a version of the code that included an unnecessary local variable. Another mistake was to choose the wrong rule to illustrate how one of the replies had been generated, because there are a number of slightly different rules.

A demo of pop11 2-D graphics commands with faces and random walks

</a>
<br/>
Available at:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsCINKXK6ek">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsCINKXK6ek</a>
</h4>
This tutorial makes use of a pop11 teach file available here
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/random_walk">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/random_walk</a>
to demonstrate some features of the 2-D graphical libraries
available in Pop11, as well as the use of the Poplog editor Ved as
an interactive learning, programming, testing and demonstration
tool.
<p>
The tutorial introduces a small subset of the RCLIB
extension to Pop11, providing a 'Relative Coordinates' graphical
package, which allows the frame of reference to be altered (e.g.
moved, stretched or rotated) so that the same graphical command has
different effects. However that feature is not demonstrated here.

<p>

Instead the tutorial shows how an existing library program can
be used to draw very simple faces with different expressions (e.g.
happy, sad) and different colours, simply using circular blobs. The
details, which are not explained or demonstrated in the tutorial can
all be found in the file:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/faces">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/faces</a>
<br/>
A learner trying various parameters for the face-drawing procedures
should be able to work out what the parameters do, as part of
learning how coordinates work.
<p>

After that introduction the tutorial shows how Pop11 and its
graphical command rc_drawby(X, Y), which draws to a location
specified relative to the previous location, can be used to explore
different sorts of random walk. For example, this command randomly
selects one element from a four-element list of pairs of coordinates
to be given to rc_draw_by:

<pre>
    rc_drawby( explode( oneof( [ [20 20] [-20 20] [-20 -20] [20 -20] ] ) ) );
</pre>

 The key features of a random walk are demonstrated
manually, and then put together in a little procedure that allows
various kinds of random walk to be demonstrated and displayed
graphically. This shows how, by playing with such a program, a
learner can begin to get an intuitive feeling for the ways in which
random walks can vary.
<p>
 The tutorial ends by mentioning that the
program can be extended to collect different sorts of statistics
about the random walks, which could be used as input for the Pop11
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/figs/rclib/graphplot/">RC_GRAPHPLOT</a>
library, which draws graphs of mathematical functions
or, of empirical data.
<p>
 So although Pop11 was designed for
teaching and research in Artificial Intelligence (and cognitive
science) it can also be used as a tool for doing research in
mathematics, especially gaining an intuitive understanding of some
features of a mathematical domain.
<p>
 The talk was unscripted and
may have a number of errors. One that I've noticed is that on more
than one occasion I referred to a delay as one second rather than
one hundredth of a second (the unit for the syssleep function).
<p>

There may be problems of synchronisation of voice and video because
the recording was done with some compression, to save file space and
download time.
I use 'recordmydesktop' on linux (Fedora 15) on a

<p>

This is one of a collection of tutorials demonstrating Pop11, a
language with some of the features of Lisp, Scheme, and Prolog,
developed for teaching and research in AI and Cognitive Science.
<p>

This unscripted tutorial turned out longer than intended. It is
based on this file, showing the program text demonstrated in the
tutorial
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/match_sorted">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/match_sorted</a>
<p>
Most people think of pattern matching as an operation performed on
strings (e.g. 'grep' in unix/linux). The matching here is on
structures, including lists of items, lists of lists, etc. So the
functions of matching in this context can be thought of as searching
in and extracting information from a database of knowledge rather
than finding and manipulating bits of text.
<p>
Because the tutorial was unscripted there are some bloopers -- e.g.
where I temporarily switched my brain into the wrong context -- e.g.
attempting to trace "matches" in an example that used "doesmatch",
not "matches".
<p>
The tutorial presents a fairly standard recursive algorithm for
checking whether a list of numbers is sorted, then shows how that
can be replaced by a non-recursive definition using the pop11
pattern matcher, which allows you to specify a sort of abstract
picture of what is not allowed in a sorted list. The pop11 matcher
compares that picture with an input list, and if it matches, the
list is not sorted.
<p>
This naive use of the matcher is shown to work, but with
considerable inefficiency. So a Pop11 library is compiled which
allows, instead of the format
<pre>
    DATUM matches PATTERN
</pre>
the format
<pre>
    DATUM doesmatch PATTERN where CONDITION
</pre>
Using the second format, the pictorial specification of what a
non-sorted list is like is somewhat clearer and its use is also much
more efficient, since the search for an unsorted fragment of the
list is more controlled.
<p>
The tutorial then shows how the procedure can be generalised to test
a variety of types of list, including lists with mixed types of
components (e.g. words and numbers) by allowing the test for
unordered elements instead of being frozen in the code to be passed
as a second parameter to the procedure. Then by using the same
procedure with different 'unordered' tests we can produce a variety
of tests for different kinds of ordering, all using the same generic
procedure.
<p>
Finally the tutorial shows how the generic procedure can be
partially applied to different specific tests (forming Pop11
closures) to create different procedures, testing for different
things.
<p>
In retrospect I think the example may be confusing for some viewers
because the task of checking whether a list satisfies a condition
(e.g. containing numbers in ascending order) requires using a test
that indicates a failure to satisfy that condition, e.g. a test for
an adjacent pair of numbers being in descending order. That implies
that a true result for the test implies a false result for the main
procedure. This complexity is a consequence of the example shown
being for something being true of ALL parts of a list, which is
equivalent to non-existence of ANY part of the list for which it is
not true. Some human brains find this hard to grasp.
<p>
The process of generalisation or abstraction from a few examples of
testing a list, then creating a new "generic" version of the test,
by abstraction, which can then be instantiated to produce new
examples,
illustrates the ability of humans to learn different competences,
then discover that those competences share some structure, and then
use the shared structure with additional parameters to cope with
novel situations.
<p>
That is a common process in mathematical discovery and in becoming
more competent at programming. It is often confused with
metaphorical thinking (which requires continued reference to the
original examples, whereas abstraction does not).
<p>
I think it is an example of the notion of "Representational
Redescription" presented by Annette Karmiloff-Smith in her 1992 book
"Beyond modularity". Implementing representational redescription in
a program is an ambitious task for Artificial Intelligence. This
tutorial does not go into that.

Originally this was a 19 minute demo, illustrating some features of
Pop11, then going on to present the Riverworld tutorial. Instead
that is now done in a separate video <a
href="http://youtu.be/RrT9DUyg88M">http://youtu.be/RrT9DUyg88M</a>.
This tutorial has been shrunk to the first 7.5 minutes of the
original.
<p>
This video is now a (mostly unscripted) tutorial presentation of
some of the arithmetical and list processing facilities in Pop11,
and the interactive mode of developing and testing programs, using
the poplog editor as a development tool.
<p>
A feature of this and other pop11 tutorials is that it can be used
on very low cost interfaces, since it uses only a textual display to
paint schematic one-dimensional pictures of the state of the world
as it changes.
<p>
Among the many tutorial files teaching aspects of Pop11 and AI that
are included in the Poplog system, one that has been found very
useful for teaching absolute beginners some of the key ideas of
programming, including sequences of instructions, grouping of
instructions into named procedures, procedures with input
parameters, and the use of error messages is the TEACH RIVER
file,log/t based on an earlier version by Max Clowes around 1978,
now online here:

The
mechanisms used in that file are built on lower level abilities of
pop11 including list processing mechanisms. This teach file is an
introduction to a small subset of the more primitive mechanisms in
pop11.

A separate tutorial file
<a href="http://youtu.be/RrT9DUyg88M">Riverworld in Pop11: introduction to programming</a>
also listed <a href="#river-teach.ogv">
below</a>,
demonstrates how a micro-world involving a man, fox, chicken and
grain with a boat that holds two items and a river to cross could
get across the river, subject to the constraints that the boat can
hold only the man and one other item at a time, and the fox should
never be left on a bank with the chicken if the man is not there,
and the chicken should not be left alone with the grain if the man
is not there.
<p>
That tutorial demonstrates that the river-crossing microworld could
be used to teach absolute beginners some of the elementary aspects
of programming, in an intuitive setting.
<p>
In contrast, this new unscripted tutorial
(<a href="http://youtu.be/M-NPoGCb0q8">http://youtu.be/M-NPoGCb0q8</a>)
aims at showing teachers how to create such a microworld using
features in Pop11 that allow programs to create, interrogate and
alter a simple database, implemented as a list of lists. Procedures
can be written that simulate perceiving the state of the world and
acting on the world, and some of the manipulation procedures can be
used to encode the causal laws and constraints of the world.
<p>
Such a world can then be used in a variety of contexts for student
exercises, e.g. natural language interaction relating to the world,
planning, problem solving, reasoning, etc. The tutorial is merely an
introduction. There are many directions that can be taken, depending
on the educational goals, the background and interests of the
students and their abilities.
<p>
The poplog system, used for this tutorial is described with examples
of teaching materials here:

<p>
NOTE: because this tutorial was unscripted, I made some minor errors
wasted about a minute in the original version. I later was able to
edit it on Fedora 15 using PiTiVi, to remove the unwanted episode.
So a new version has been uploaded. Youtube does not allow an old
faulty video to be replaced, so the new version had to go to a
different location.

Among the many tutorial files teaching aspects of Pop11 and AI that are included in the Poplog system, one that has been found very useful for teaching absolute beginners some of the key ideas of programming, including sequences of instructions,
grouping of instructions into named procedures, procedures with input parameters, and the use of error messages is the TEACH RIVER file, based on an earlier version by Max Clowes around 1978, now online here:
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/river
<p>
This video is a tutorial presentation of some of the key ideas in that teach file, while also introducing the use of the poplog editor Ved as a programming environment, and some of the ways of using pop11 for interactive programming.
<p>
This teach file introduces the river-crossing puzzle: get man, fox, chicken, and grain, across a river using a boat that can old only the man and one other item, without ever leaving the fox with the chicken, or the chicken with the grain,
on a bank without the man present to prevent a vulnerable item from being eaten. Students are first asked to work out a solution away from the computer and then they try to express their solution using a specially developed 'micro-language'
for the river world, with commands like putin(fox), takeout(chicken), getin(), getout(), crossriver(). When a sequence of instructions solving the problem has been found it can be made much shorter and clearer by defining new procedures for
invoking frequently used sequences of instructions.
<p>
A feature of this tutorial is that it can be used on very low cost interfaces, since it uses only a textual display to paint schematic one-dimensional pictures of the state of the world as it changes.
<p>
Teachers can, of course, copy and edit the library program, the teach files, or other files that are used by this one, or which build on it.
<p>
Several other teach files in the Pop11 library develop this micro-world, e.g. by allowing students to design their own implementation for the world representation and the actions that change the world, or by adding a chatbot-like natural language
interface to the program, or by using the poprulebase system (for rule-based programming) to get the computer to find a sequence of moves that solves the problem, using breadth first or depth first search. for example the addition of a natural
language interface is the subject of this teach file
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/riverchat
<p>
This illustrates the use of microworlds for teaching important concepts and techniques, especially in symbolic Artificial Intelligence.
<p>
This is one of several
tutorials based on the river world. An earlier tutorial showed how a teacher could use the list processing and pattern-matching features of pop11 to set up a
microworld like the riverworld, which could the be used
as a basis for a number of different learning scenarios for beginner or more advanced programmers.

Pop11 is an AI language with a general purpose-core that is in some
ways like Scheme, in other ways like Forth (use of an open stack).
<p>
This tutorial demonstrates some of the main "built-in" data-types
(integers, decimals, complex/imaginary numbers, strings, words,
lists, vectors, properties
and procedures),
some of the kinds of programming
constructs, for referring to entities (expression formats),
including expressions for referring to or constructing examples of
all the above entities,
the use of the poplog open stack,
and some of the control constructs provided,
including use of nested loops vs use of parallel loops. The latter
is an unusual, but very useful feature.
<p>
Nested loops can be used for doing something to all possible
combinations of items from several different lists.
<p>
Parallel loops repeatedly do something to a group of items, one selected
from each of several different lists, so that each list item is used
only once. The loop stops after all members of the
shortest list have been used.
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Two "nested" loops</b>

    vars item1, item2;

    ;;; Outer loop iterates over items in list of words
    for item1 in [a b c d e] do

        ;;; Inner loop iterates over items in list of words
        for item2 in [1 2 3 4 5] do

            [^item1 ^item2 ]

        endfor

    endfor =>

;;; That prints out:
** [a 1] [a 2] [a 3] [a 4] [a 5] [b 1] [b 2] [b 3] [b 4] [b 5] [c 1] [c 2] [c 3] [c 4]
    [c 5] [d 1] [d 2] [d 3] [d 4] [d 5] [e 1] [e 2] [e 3] [e 4] [e 5]


<b>Two "parallel" loops</b>

    vars item1, item2;

    ;;; One loop, with two loop variables, one iterating over a list of words
    ;;; the other iterating over a list of numbers:

    for item1, item2 in [a b c d e], [1 2 3 4 5] do

            [^item1 ^item2 ]

Most of the tutorials on this web site make use of the Poplog editor
Ved, or its multi-window version XVed, to demonstrate features of AI
programming, testing of programs, searching for documentation,
editing program code, etc. This short video (just over 9 minutes)
illustrates uses of Xved and Ved that invoke some of Pop11's 2-D
graphics capabilities, including handling multiple text windows,
using  (user definable) graphical menus, and running programs that
invoke graphical displays. It was originally intended as an
introduction to a longer tutorial on the uses of the editor.
However, it made the tutorial too long, so I separated this from the
main tutorial which is the video that will be uploaded after this
(Essentials of Ved, the Poplog Editor
at: <a href="http://youtu.be/h8zv_un5k3k">http://youtu.be/h8zv_un5k3k</a>)
and
<a href="#vedkeys">the Ved Keys tutorial, below.</a>
<p>
The video quality of this tutorial is very poor for some reason. So
I may replace it later.
<p>
The next tutorial, will show the Ved editor being used in single
window mode, and will present the most commonly used keyboard
commands for getting things done.

 The previous tutorial
(<a
href="http://youtu.be/Athf7cFbk3E">http://youtu.be/Athf7cFbk3E</a>(
rapidly ran through some of the things that
can be done with the Poplog editor XVed, using its 2-D graphical
capabilities. including use of multiple windows and mouse drive menu
panels. This tutorial goes to the opposite extreme to show how Ved
can be used not only without 2-D graphics, but also without any
function keys, so that it has to be driven only by normal
alphanumeric keyboard keys, along with CTRL, ESC, RETURN, and
Backspace.
<p>
This situation can arise when either there is something wrong with a
keyboard, or the keyboard is small and lacks function keys (e.g. on
a laptop), or the use of the function keys is not available to Ved
because they are 'grabbed' by the operating system or graphical
desktop interface.
<p>
In such a situation it is possible to drive Ved and do normal
programming, development, testing, and reading of documentation,
using only a minimal set of keyboard keys, namely all the
alphanumeric keys plus the CTRL and ESC keys.
<p>
This tutorial explains how to move the Ved cursor around, how to
delete text, how to mark portions of a file, how to mark and compile
portions of a file, and how to switch between different files, while
using nothing but the minimal set of keyboard keys. There are other
help files that explain additional actions that can be performed
using the keyboard, and without a mouse or 2-D graphical facilities.
<p>
The 'teach file' used for this tutorial is available as part of
poplog, and also available online here:

The previous tutorial demonstrated some of the things that can be
done with the Poplog editor Ved/XVed without using any function
keys, only normal keyboard keys and the ESC and CTRL keys. This
tutorial goes beyond that to show how many of the operations can be
performed more economically using function keys on a standard PC
keyboard.
<p>
The keyboard layout is shown in this diagram

<p>
Near the end of the tutorial I tried to demonstrate the use of the
numeric keypad to compile a marked range, but forgot to precede the
key with ESC. So instead of compiling the whole range it compiled
only the last line of the marked range, and reported a syntax error,
because it found the 'endrepeat' syntax word without first finding
the 'repeat'. If I had pressed ESC first, the demonstration would
have worked, as you can confirm if you have poplog. (The correct
behaviour is demonstrated in the next tutorial
<a
href="http://youtu.be/giEhHIN8z6I">http://youtu.be/giEhHIN8z6I</a>)
<p>
In fact, as shown in the demo, the marked range can be compiled
using CTRL D, which is probably more convenient for most people than
ESC followed by keypad '*' key.

keypad keys in the poplog editor, I attempted to demonstrate the use
of the '*' key on the keypad to compile a number of lines of Pop-11
code, which had previously been marked, using the Mark Start and
Mark End function keys.
<p>
Unfortunately I forgot to press the ESC key before pressing the '*'
key, so instead of compiling a range it attempted to compile only
one line, and that line had 'endrepeat', which is not legal Pop11
unless preceded by 'repeat'. The result was an error message which,
at the time, mystified me. See the last few minutes of this video

<p>
Later I realised what I should have done,
and so this tutorial is a supplement to the previous one, partly
repeating the previous one and also correcting the mistake at the
end of the previous one.
