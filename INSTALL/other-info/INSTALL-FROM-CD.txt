This file is
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/linux-cd/INSTALL-FROM-CD.txt

These instructions assume you have followed preliminary steps 1 to 4 in
the file

    AREADME.txt

available online as
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/linux-cd/AREADME.txt
and included in the CD.

So the directory /usr/local/poplog is assumed to exist though it may
actually be a link to a directory on a different partition.

-- INSTALLING FROM BIRMINGHAM POPLOG CD

If you have a copy of a poplog CD from the University of Birmingham
made later than 01 Sept 2002 it will have all of the required
files in a single tar file:
    bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz
    (about 20 Mbytes)
Including a copy of this file.

If you mount the CD it should make the file accessible as something
like this:
    /mnt/cdrom/bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz

I'll assume you already have the CD mounted so that that file exists
or something like it, e.g. perhaps

    /cdrom/bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz

(The exact file location will depend on your version of linux).

Modify the instructions below to correspond to the location of the file
on your CD.

-- STEP 1: Create "source" directory into which to copy tar file from CD
Recommended location: /usr/local/poplog/src/

You need to copy the file from the CD and install it
somewhere.

Make a new directory for poplog SOURCE files copied from the CD, to be
used for installation.

Create directory for the source files.

    mkdir -p /usr/local/poplog/src

[Note for experts: you can choose a different location, but will then
have to alter some of the other instructions below.]


-- STEP 2: Copy the file from the CD to your hard drive:

Use 'cp -p' to preserve date information when copying:

    cp -p /mnt/cdrom/bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz /usr/local/poplog/src/

(you may have to alter that command if your CD is not mounted as
/mnt/cdrom/ )

Check that the new file exists, using this command:

    ls -l /usr/local/poplog/src

It should show you that you have a file about 20 million bytes in size
with this name:

    /usr/local/poplog/src/bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz

Later on you can delete that file after you have successfully extracted
its contents.


-- STEP 3. Change to the source directory

Change to the new directory -- i.e. make it your current working
directory:

    cd /usr/local/poplog/src

(This is NOT where poplog will be installed: it is merely a place to
hold the files used to install poplog. By default the installation will
be in the directory /usr/local/poplog, though you can choose another
place by editing the installation scripts if you wish).

You are now ready to extract the files from the tar file.
After that you can use them to install poplog


-- STEP 4. Extract files from the main poplog tar file,

(assuming you are in the directory to which you have copied it
e.g. /usr/local/poplog/src)

    zcat bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz | tar xf -

This will create a new sub-directory called "linux-poplog"
containing the extracted files, i.e.

    /usr/local/poplog/src/linux-poplog/

It will also create a file something like this, which you can ignore

    AATARBUILD-Sun Sep  1 17:32:55 BST 2002

and this file a bit over 12 mbytes in size:
    linux-poplog.tar.gz

-- Step 5: untar the linux-poplog.tar.gz file

The next thing to do is untar that file which will put more things in
the linux-poplog sub-directory.

    zcat linux-poplog/linux-poplog.tar.gz | tar xf -

-- Step 6: Change to the linux-poplog sub-directory

    cd linux-poplog

List its contents:

    ls -l

This should list over 30 files. The number may change from
time to time, depending on how poplog is packaged. It should include
this file. The files whose names end '.txt' are instruction
files. See what's there:

    ls -l *.txt


The files whose names start 'INSTALL' but do not end in '.txt' are shell
scripts that you can run to do the installation, as described below.

List them:

    ls -l INSTALL* | grep -v txt

There should be at least three of them. (The number may change.)

Some of the other files are essential for poplog in any form. Some are
essential for the core Birmingham poplog setup.

The files linuxstuff.html and linuxstuff.txt give descriptions of the
various files.

Check where you are, by giving the print working directory command:

    pwd

That should print out something like:

    /usr/local/poplog/src/linux-poplog

you should find a file called
    INSTALL-FINAL.txt

check with this command
    ls -l INSTALL-FINAL.txt

That is the basic instruction file for installing poplog after you have
extracted all the required files from the CD and unpacked the main
tar files.

The instructions may change as new versions of Poplog are produced.

-- Step 7. READ INSTALL-FINAL.txt and follow instructins

You can read the file online with the command

    more INSTALL-FINAL.txt

(press space bar to get another page, press "b" to go back to previous
page). You may find it helpful to print that file before proceeding.
You can then make notes of the steps you go through and what happens,
in case there is a problem and you have to ask for help.

If you are happy to proceed with installation, follow the instructions
in there.
