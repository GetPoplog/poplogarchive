(Still being revised)

Before this, read
    AREADME.txt

and the files referred to therein.


MAIN POPLOG INSTALLATION SCRIPT

This script will unpack the compressed tar file in the /usr/local/poplog
directory. It then runs some programs to build certain core saved images
used by Poplog for system purposes, and also builds the default versions
of pop-11, common lisp, prolog and ml, as provided in the version of
Poplog that used to be distributed by ISL. Those saved images will go
into the directory $usepop/pop/lib/psv/

The script then goes on to run INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM, which unpacks some
additional tar files containing facilities developed at Birmingham,
storing them in /usr/local/poplog/local, and uses them to create a new
set of saved images for pop-11, prolog, common lisp, and ML, stored in
$usepop/poplocalbin

NOTE:
    There are two versions of the main installation script, one for
    installation with motif and one for installation without.

    With motif:
        Run the script
            INSTALL_MOTIF_POPLOG
        in the final stage.
        (You may have to edit out the poplink command if that fails, as
         it apparently does on Mandrake 8.2)

    Without motif:
        Use
            INSTALL_NOMOTIF


    All the scripts install the Poplog system in /usr/local/poplog
    as described above. You can edit the scripts use a different
    location if you wish.

    (See instructions above about choosing a disk partition.)

    INSTALL_MOTIF_POPLOG
        This will install the main poplog system, linked
        to run with motif.

    INSTALL_NOMOTIF

        This will install the main poplog system, linked
        to run without motif. It does this by obeying the same
        instructions as the first script except that at one point
        it runs this command
            $usepop/pop/src/newpop -link -x=-xt

        which re-links the core image basepop11 to remove reliance on
        motif.

    When you are ready to install poplog type one of the following
    two commands, using the second option if you do not have
    motif installed:

        Option 1: with motif

            ./INSTALL_MOTIF_POPLOG | tee  install.log | more

                This can be abbreviated as
                ./run_install

        Option 2: without motif
            ./INSTALL_NOMOTIF | tee  install.log | more

                This can be abbreviated as
                ./run_install_nomotif

        The script will untar the pclinux poplog file and install it in
        /usr/local/poplog, and will then run the script

            INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM

        as described below. Note that the above commands use the "more"
        utility which will show you a screen at a time of output, and
        then pause. When it pauses and prints "--More--" at the  bottom
        of the screen, press the space bar to continue.

    If you wish to change anything, e.g. the location where poplog is
    installed, you can edit the appropriate install script before
    running it.

    When installation is complete, the contents of the file
        checkout.txt
    will be printed out. You can also read it in an editor or
    do this to read it:

        more checkout.txt

    It gives some examples of things you can try to check that the
    installation has worked.

    After installation make sure you read the install.log file to check
    what has happened. There are several warning messages printed out
    during rebuilding of the common lisp saved image. These can be
    ignored.

    Other warning messages may be serious.

    There will be a number of packages which are not automatically
    installed. You can choose to install them, as described in the file

        INSTALL-OPTIONS.txt

=======================================================================


    INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM

        This is a shell script which installs a collection of packages
        from Birmingham and Sussex.

        It is automatically run by the INSTALL_MOTIF_POPLOG script,
        and also the INSTALL_NOMOTIF script, so you do not need to run
        it.

        If, for any reason, you have to run it on its own later,
        e.g. after re-installing poplog, you run it, with the command

            ./INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM >  installbham.log

        You can then read the install.log file to see what it has
        and has not done and follow any remaining isntructions.


NB
If trying to run poplog produces an error message mentioning
    libXm.so  or just Xm

then please re-read the file
    AREADME.motifcheck.txt

IF YOU NEED FURTHER HELP OR ADVICE:
    Post your questions to the
        comp.lang.pop news group
    or to
        pop-forum@cs.bham.ac.uk

Be as specific as possible. In particular state what sort of computer
you are using, which operating system, which version of poplog, and
exactly what you did, what (if anything) was printed out, and what you
expected to happen. Helpers are not mind-readers, though they are
willing to help if the task is not too hard.
