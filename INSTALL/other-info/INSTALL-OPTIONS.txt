WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE INSTALLATION OF THE REQUIRED FILES

There are optional packages available that you may decide to install.

You can then go back to the directory
    /usr/local/poplog/src/linux-poplog/

If you obtained the poplog system via the CD, you will find
several optional extra packages are there waiting for you to install
them if you wish, e.g.
    newkit.tar.gz
        (The sim_agent toolkit)
    brait.tar.gz
        (A braitenberg vehicle demo which requires sim_agent)
    popvision.tar.gz
        (David Young's sussex vision library and teaching files)
    neural.tar.gz
        (An introduction to neural nets)
    vedgn.tar.gz
        (Pop-11 programs for reading and posting news via VED.
        This assumes that you have access to a news server.)

Alternatively if you have not used the CD but fetched poplog from the
Web site, you can also fetch the above files from this directory:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/linux-cd/


You can use the install_package script to install the optional extras:

E.g. if, after running the INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM script, you wish to
install the popvision.tar.gz package, fetch it and install it
in the same directory as the other files you unpacked from the tar
file, then do:

    ./install_package popvision

i.e. in the directory containing popvision.tar.gz
(You may wish to read the install_package script and modify it.)

Other files not installed automatically, which can be installed
like this are listed below


The packages provided are:

    bham.tar.gz
        a collection of local teaching programs and documentation,
        in regular use in Birmingham. This is used by some of the other
        packages. This is installed by the INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM script,
        which is automatically invoked.

        This includes, among other things:
            A collection of utilities making it easy to run Poplog
            programs, e.g. pop-11, Ved, XVed, prolog, clisp, pml, etc.
            without editing your login files or .Xdefault file, included
            in this directory
                $poploca/local/setup
            with some important files for starting up poplog, along with
            "man" files and a brief introductory userguide.

        For details see setup/AREADME after you have installed it.



    emacs.tar.gz
        If you are an emacs user you may find this useful, if you want
        to run pop11 etc. from emacs rather than from Ved/Xved
        If you have any questions about this post them to the
        comp.lang.pop news group or to the emacs-users email list
        (if you are at Birmingham University).
        NOT installed automatically, but included in the bham.tar.gz
        file.

    install_package
        This is a shell script that can be used to install the packages
        that are not installed automatically after you have run the
        INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM script described above.

    mklinks.afs
        Need only if you have errors about not being able to create
        hard links. Very unlikely unless you are using the Andrew File
        System.

    newc_dec.tar.gz
        Needed only if you are an expert wishing to link in external
        programs written in C. This provides support for ANSI and
        K&R C.
        NOT installed automatically


    pophtmlprimer.tar.gz
        HTML version of the pop-11 primer.
        If you unpack this you can read the pop11 primer using
        netscape or lynx. The contents are the same as the
        teach file which can be read in Ved:
            TEACH primer
        except for some extra diagrams. Some people find the HTML
        version easier to read because of the cross-links.

        The master version of the primer is here:
            http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/primer/
            http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/pophtmlprimer.tar.gz

        Postscript and latex versions are also available for formatted
        printing, at

        NOT installed automatically

    rclib.tar.gz
        The RCLIB library with extensions to RC_GRAPHIC. Needed for the
        menus and control panels used in Birmingham.
        Installed by default. Included in the saved images created by
        INSTALL_LIKE_BHAM

    rcmenu.tar.gz
        The Pop-11/VED "menu" package. This can work ONLY if you have
        RCLIB installed (i.e. needs rclib.tar.gz)
        Installed by default (needed for Ved's control menus).

    ved_latex.embedded.tar.gz
        Facilities for running latex from inside the editor. Includes
        tutorial introductions.

    Post your questions to the
        comp.lang.pop news group or to
        pop-forum@cs.bham.ac.uk

Be as specific as possible. In particular state what sort of computer
you are using, which operating system, which version of poplog, and
exactly what you did, what (if anything) was printed out, and what you
expected to happen. Helpers are not mind-readers, though they are
willing to help if the task is not too hard.

OPTIONAL: DELETING THE MASTER TAR FILE
The master tar file
    bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz
    which will be in the directory /usr/local/poplog/src

can safely be deleted after installation is complete.

It is just a copy of what is on the CD. Moreover, you will have
all of its contents unpacked in the sub-directory linux-poplog.

But you may wish to make a backup copy of that before deletion and
also of the contents of
    /usr/local/poplog/

after deletion of that file.
