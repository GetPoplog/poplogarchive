-- Step 1 Do some preliminary checks

Look at the file

    AREADME.txt

and go through preliminary steps 1, 2, 3, 4 specified in there.
(Some of that file is not relevant if you are installing a minimal
linux poplog system).

This involves reading these two files which you should have in this
directory:

    AREADME.motifcheck.txt

    Suse-Readme.txt
        (If you are using Suse Linux or any other that does not
        include termcap).


-- STEP 2: Create directory in which to install files

Recommended location: /usr/local/poplog/v15.53a

If you are reading this you have already untarred it somewhere. You can
either make a symbolic link from where you untarred it to
/usr/local/poplog/v15.53a

    mkdir /usr/local/poplog
    ln -s <directory> /usr/local/poplog/v15.53a

or move the files you have untarred into /usr/local/poplog

    mkdir -p /usr/local/poplog/V15.53a

Untar the tar ball in there.

Create a directory for local extensions to poplog (packages you can
download and install, or your own extensions)

    mkdir /usr/local/poplog/local

-- STEP 3. Relink Poplog and build saved images

If you want to use poplog with motif (recommended) then run this
script
    ./LINK_MOTIF_POPLOG

If you want to use it without motif, then run this:

    ./LINK_NOMOTIF_POPLOG

Both of those will rebuild binaries and some system saved images in
    /usr/local/poplog/v15.53a/pop/pop

and create saved images for pop11 (startup.psv), lisp, prolog ML and
Xved in

    /usr/local/poplog/v15.53a/pop/lib/psv/

For more information see

    /usr/local/poplog/v15.53a/userguide.html

You can check out that pop11 works by giving the following commands:

-- Testing step 1: setup environment ----------------------------------

First make sure that you have set up environment variables, with these
commands, which can put in your .login or .bashrc file

(a) If your shell is tcsh or csh do

    setenv usepop /usr/local/poplog/v15.53a
    source $usepop/pop/com/poplog
    rehash

(b) If your shell bash, or ksh, or sh do this instead:

    usepop=/usr/local/poplog/v15.53a
    export usepop
    # note the dot in the next line:
    . $usepop/pop/com/poplog.sh


-- Testing step 2: run pop11 and Eliza --------------------------------

This command will work after the above:

    pop11

then when you get the colon prompt ":"

    : eliza();

Read the instructions printed out and treat yourself to a free
psychotherapy session.


-- Testing step 3: learn to use the editor ----------------------------

To run the poplog editor ved, do
    poplog ved

To run the multi-window version (recommended) do

    poplog xved

When ved is running, type ^G (the ENTER command) then

    teach quickved

Then press the RETURN key (below backspace).

This will give you a tutorial on using Ved.

If you master Ved or XVed, that will make everything else
easier.

-- Using Emacs and getting additional libraries and packages ----------

For people who prefer to use Emacs, fetch and untar:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/emacs.tar.gz

There are additional utilities and packages described here

    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html

-- Asking for help ----------------------------------------------------

You can ask for help via the comp.lang.pop newsgroup or the pop-forum
email list (they are linked). It is best to join the list, at least for
a while.
